        "text": "Netflix is apparently planning to debut a new service called \u2018N-Plus\u2019. The service aims to offer behind-the-scenes information and other features related to Netflix shows. The company has now reportedly started sending out surveys to gain user feedback before launching it for everyone.\n\nNetflix N-Plus\n\nAccording to Protocol, Netflix describes N-Plus as a \u201cfuture online space where you can learn more about the Netflix shows and things related to them.\u201d The survey further hinted about features such as podcasts, user-generated playlists, and more.\n\nNetflix currently distributes behind-the-scenes content, interviews, and promotional podcasts through social media platforms such as Instagram and YouTube. With the N-Plus service, the company may be planning to rely less on other platforms, and build a community around Netflix instead.\n\nOf the features shown in the survey, one noteworthy part is the option to create custom playlists. This way, users could easily compile playlists of their favorite movies and TV shows on Netflix and share them with their friends. If the recipient doesn\u2019t have a Netflix subscription, they\u2019ll only see the trailer of the shows.\n\nIn addition, Netflix is planning to bring the aforesaid functionality to original soundtracks of Netflix shows. The idea is that Netflix will list all the music from a show and you, as a Netflix user, can create playlists from it, presumably by redirecting you to leading music streaming services.\n\nUser Reviews on Netflix?\n\nWhat interests me the most about N-Plus is that the company is also planning to host user reviews of TV shows. Apart from all this, N-Plus may also let people give feedback for shows that are still in pre-production. It may even show up on Google Search when you search for Netflix movies.\n\nWhen Protocol reached out to Netflix, a spokesperson said that the survey was part of the company\u2019s regular efforts to poll its audience on things the company was exploring. We don\u2019t know how many of these features will make it to the final version of N-Plus. In fact, it\u2019s not certain if Netflix would actually launch N-Plus. N-Plus seems to be a compelling addition to Netflix and it will be interesting to see how it turns out.",

        "text": "Samsung has today announced that an update for its digital assistant, Bixby, is rolling out with support for Indian English. The Bixby 3.0 update is \u201caimed at controlling of daily scenarios through the new and improved Indian English avatar,\u201d as per the blog post.\n\nWhat\u2019s the benefit of using Indian English, you ask? Samsung says that Bixby can now \u201cunderstand Indian names, places, relationships, content, and recipes\u201d among many other things. Users can even ask the voice assistant to place calls to relatives or family members by saying, \u201cHi Bixby, call Maa\u201d (Maa = Mother) or \u201cHi Bixby, call Bhaiya\u201d (Bhaiya = Brother). You will need to define the relationships, along with the corresponding contact, in the Bixby app to make use of this nifty new feature.\n\nWe first learned about Samsung\u2019s plan to introduce Indian English support a couple of weeks ago. If you open the Bixby app on a supported device, you will see a banner at the top which reads \u2013 \u201cIndian English Available Now!!\u201d You can tap on this banner to change the assistant\u2019s language to English (India). This language option will be available by default when setting up new phones. You can see the screenshots for this new feature attached above.\n\nBesides the Indian language support, Bixby can now help you start recording slo-mo videos, enable power-saving mode, turn on/ off the wireless hotspot, and remember your vehicle\u2019s parking spot as well.\n\nThe Bixby 3.0 update is currently available on the flagship Galaxy S21 series and the recently launched Galaxy A52 and Galaxy A72. Samsung states that Galaxy Note 20 series, S20 series, and Galaxy Fold are next in line to receive the new India-centric features.

Whether it\u2019s icon packs and Android launchers or apps that customize menus and more, there\u2019s a lot you can do with your Android phone. Now, if you have a OnePlus phone, you will be glad to know that apart from all the customization options that OxygenOS already offers, you will also get a theme store with the OxygenOS 12 update really soon.\n\nThe announcement for the theme store comes via the OnePlus forums, where the company announced that it will be made available with the next major OS update \u2014 that would be OxygenOS 12, which means it\u2019s not too far away (hopefully).\n\nTheme Stores aren\u2019t a new idea, in fact, Samsung has a pretty gigantic catalog of themes (both free and paid) on its own theme store for One UI. There are also a lot of outstanding MIUI themes out there. However, bringing it to OnePlus phones has been one of the major demands from the community, and the company is finally doing it.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the OnePlus theme store will be a free affair, or whether paid themes will be available on the store as well. It\u2019s more likely that there will be a mix of both free and paid themes, but we\u2019ll have to wait for the OxygenOS 12 launch to learn more.\n\nMeanwhile, the company is hosting an online Open Ears Forum for the theme store. So, if you have any thoughts on the OxygenOS 12 theme store, complaints, suggestions, or anything, you should definitely apply to be a part of the forum. Interested people can apply via the forum (or by clicking this link).\n\nThe OEF event will be held on May 18, from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm IST. People who are selected to be a part of the OEF will also get goodies, including a Hasselblad postcard, an OEF pin, and a T-shirt.",

        "text": "Twitter, of late, has been working on a boatload of new features. The company recently started rolling out its Clubhouse-like audio room feature called \u2018Twitter Spaces\u2018 to all users across the globe. And now, the company has announced yet another addition to the platform \u2014 Tip Jar.\n\nThe concept is fairly simple and self-explanatory. Twitter users can now add a new \u2018Tip Jar\u2019 button that looks like a dollar bill to their profile page. To use the feature, you tap on the button on anyone\u2019s profile (provided they have activated the feature) and you get options to tip them. Twitter is supporting many payment apps, including Venmo, Cashapp, PayPal, Patreon, and Bandcamp, so you can choose the payment method you want to use.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable that Twitter is bringing this feature to its native mobile app on iOS and Android. After all, users have been using Twitter to attract tips and donations for a long time now. You\u2019ve probably seen links to Venmo and Cashapp, or even someone\u2019s SoundCloud page under a viral tweet in the past. With this new feature, Twitter is simply incorporating that into its own service, natively. While we cannot set up a Tip Jar on our profile right now, we saw the feature available on certain profiles on Twitter.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the tip jar is only available on the profile page of a Twitter user. Users looking to tip a creator or someone they want to support therefore will have to head to their profile in order to tip them some money. As of right now, it doesn\u2019t seem that Twitter has plans to make this feature available in more places on Twitter, but that could always change with time.\n\nRight now, Twitter says the feature is only available to users who use the platform in English, and it\u2019s making Tip Jar available to only a limited group of people, including journalists, non-profits, experts, and creators. Meanwhile, anyone who uses Twitter in English can start tipping people who have Tip Jar enabled.",

        "text": "Google is taking an important step to ensure the online security of its users on World Password Day. The company knows that passwords alone are not enough to protect your accounts today. Thus, it will enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for all users by default in the near future.\n\nIn an official blog post, Google says that it will \u201cstart automatically enrolling users in 2SV if their accounts are appropriately configured\u201d really soon. 2SV here stands for two-step verification, which is what Google calls its two-factor authentication system.\n\nThe company didn\u2019t elaborate on what it means by appropriately configured. But we assume if you have an Android phone linked to your Google account or an iPhone with the Google Smart Lock app (Free), then you will easily be able to log into your accounts without your password.\n\nOnce two-factor authentication is enabled, you will see a prompt on your smartphone to verify you are trying to log into your Google account. \u201cUsing their mobile device to sign in gives people a safer and more secure authentication experience than passwords alone,\u201d says Mark Risher, Director of Product Management, Identity and User Security in an official blog post.\n\nIn addition to using your smartphone as a two-factor authentication device, you can now also use physical security keys to further safeguard your Google account. You will also be able to disable two-factor authentication, but we advise against it. With the rise in online data leaks and account hacks, we suggest you bolster your account security.\n\nTo protect your private data, we suggest you check if your password has leaked in any online data breaches, reset your password, set up two-factor authentication on all your accounts, and use password manager apps for additional security. Also, we suggest you don\u2019t use weak passwords that are easy to crack and gain access to your account.",

You\u2019ll now see a toggle to turn on this feature in the watch\u2019s settings.

        "text": "Asus is all set to take the wraps off its next flagship smartphone series, the ZenFone 8 series, globally on 12th May. Ahead of its official unveiling, the press renders and the complete specifications sheet of the upcoming devices has leaked online (courtesy of 91Mobiles).\n\nAsus will launch the compact ZenFone 8 and the flip camera-laden ZenFone 8 Flip next week. So, let\u2019s take a look at the specifications of these two phones:\n\nZenFone 8 Flip: Specifications (Leaked)\n\nAs the name tells, Asus will continue to offer a motorized flip camera aboard its next flagship smartphone. The front of the ZenFone 8 Flip will feature a 6.67-inch Full-HD+ AMOLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate. There are no punch-hole, notches, or massive bezels on the front. The flip camera doubles as the selfie camera here.\n\nAsus ZenFone 8 Flip will include a motorized triple camera setup, which is rumored to have a 64MP Sony IMX686 sensor at the helm. You will also find a 12MP ultra-wide camera (with 4cm macro support), and an 8MP telephoto camera onboard.\n\nUnder the hood, the flagship Snapdragon 888 5G chipset will power the ZenFone 8 Flip. It will be coupled with 8GB LPDDR5 RAM and 256GB UFS 3.1 storage. The device will run Android 11-based ZenUI, which is close to stock, out-of-the-box. Further, you will also find a massive 5,000mAh battery with 30W fast charging.\n\nZenFone 8: Specifications (Leaked)\n\nMoving to its compact sibling, the standard ZenFone 8 has a more standard design and does not include a flip camera. As per the 91Mobiles report, it will boast a 5.92-inch Full-HD+ AMOLED display. The report does not explicitly mention the refresh rate, so we\u2019re going to assume it\u2019s a regular 60Hz panel.\n\nAlso, as you can see in the renders above, there\u2019s a punch-hole cutout for the selfie camera at the top left corner of the display. The dual-rear camera system, on the other hand, will have a 64MP primary sensor and a 12MP ultra-wide lens with a macro mode. This compact phone does not have a telephoto camera onboard.\n\nUnder the hood, this smartphone will also be powered by the Snapdragon 888 5G chipset \u2013 the same as the ZenFone 8 Flip. It will include 8GB RAM and 128GB built-in storage, says the report. There\u2019s also a 5,000mAh battery with 30W charging here. But, the highlight of the ZenFone 8 will be the presence of a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is now a novelty in high-end flagship smartphones.\n\nSo are you excited for an Android flagship competitor to the iPhone 12 mini? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below. And stay tuned for price and availability details as we will be covering the launch as it happens next week.",

But no one would ever imagine Apple leaving a secret developer mode accessible to users in the companion Find My app. Well, it appears like the Cupertino giant wasn\u2019t as thorough in this case. A Redditor recently stumbled upon a developer mode in the Find My app, by chance. To experience it yourself, here\u2019s how you can enable Apple AirTag\u2019s hidden developer mode on your iPhone.\n\nEnable Developer Mode for Apple AirTag\n\nBefore Apple decides to patch the Find My app, here are the steps you need to follow to activate the AirTag developer mode:\n\nNote: You need to be using an iPhone with the U1 chip to access the Precision Finding feature to use this feature. That means you can only enable AirTag\u2019s developer mode on iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 series devices.\n\nSteps to Turn on AirTag\u2019s Developer Menu\n\n1.

You should now see a bunch of data, along with sliders to adjust the background color, the dot animation for Precision Finding, battery saver settings, and more.\n\nApple AirTag Developer Menu Settings: Explained\n\nIf you are wondering what all the toggles and sliders in AirTag\u2019s developer mode do, we have explained each of them right here:\n\nDots : It lets you adjust the number of dots that appear on the screen as part of the Precision Finding animation. You can adjust it between 4 to 1000.\n\n: It lets you adjust the number of dots that appear on the screen as part of the Precision Finding animation. You can adjust it between 4 to 1000.

Most of them are software-based, which means you don\u2019t even need to spend any extra money to get them done. Here are our recommendations:\n\n1. Enable Game Mode in Windows 10\n\nPerhaps the easiest and most obvious way to tweak performance on your PC is to enable the \u2018Game Mode\u2018 in Windows 10. The feature stops background activities like Windows updates and app notifications to help boost FPS in your games.\n\nThe Game Mode is \u2018On\u2019 by default, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to do a quick check. To do that, go to Settings (Windows key + I) > Gaming > Game Mode (left sidebar). You\u2019ll now see a \u2018Game Mode\u2019 toggle in the right pane. Switch it on if it isn\u2019t already.\n\n2. Lower Your Game\u2019s Resolution and Graphics Settings\n\nIf your PC is a super-high-end beast, you probably don\u2019t need much tweaking anyways. But if you are like the rest of us and have to make do with something less than top-tier, you may need to make some sacrifices in the graphics department for smoother gameplay. Lowering your game\u2019s graphics settings can improve FPS by easing the load on the GPU. It won\u2019t have to support as many pixels with each frame.\n\nMost dedicated gaming PCs of relatively recent vintage can handle 1080p@60FPS in most games. However, some might struggle to support 4K or even 2K resolutions, while your typical office laptop might even struggle with 1080p gaming. So make sure you try out a few options to find the optimal balance between graphics quality and higher FPS.\n\nSome games will have simple settings like ultra, high, medium, and low, while others have sliders, numerical settings, etc. Here\u2019s a quick look at some of the options in PUBG.\n\n3. Update Graphics Drivers to Optimize Windows 10 PC for Gaming\n\nAnother classic piece of troubleshooting advice is updating the GPU to the latest drivers can greatly enhance gaming performance. The chart below from Nvidia shows how drivers can help improve FPS in games by as much as 23% in some cases. The same holds for AMD Radeon drivers as well. If you\u2019re new to PC gaming, follow our detailed guide on how to update drivers on your Windows 10 PC.\n\n4. Disable SuperFetch (SysMain)\n\nSysMain (formerly SuperFetch) is a built-in Windows feature that improves startup times for apps and Windows itself. However, games do not generally benefit from it. Indeed, background activity often increases when it is enabled, but turning it off can improve gaming performance on your Windows 10 PC. Check out our detailed guide on reducing CPU and memory usage to learn how you can turn off SysMain (SuperFetch) on your computer.\n\nNote: Disabling SysMain (Superfetch) is redundant if you\u2019re using an SSD, but some HDD users might benefit from it.\n\n5. Disable Prefetch\n\nTo disable Prefetch, you will need to dig around in the Windows registry. So search for \u2018regedit\u2019 in the Windows search bar and open the registry editor. Then, navigate to the following key using the left pane: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \\ SYSTEM \\ CurrentControlSet \\ Control \\ Session Manager \\ Memory Management \\ PrefetchParameters . Now double-click on EnablePrefetcher in the right pane and change the DWORD (32-bit) Value to \u201c0\u201d (without quotes).\n\n6. Enable Focus Assist\n\nNotification pop-ups and the accompanying chimes can interrupt games, and this is where the Focus Assist feature comes in handy. Focus Assist in Windows 10 lets you specify how and when you receive notifications. So to prevent annoying messages and pop-ups when you\u2019re gaming, open Settings (can also use the shortcut Windows key +I) -> System -> Focus Assist. Now select \u2018Alarms Only\u2019 or \u2018Priority Only\u2019 to hide all unnecessary pop-ups.\n\n7. Switch Off Background Services\n\nYou can also prevent apps, including some Windows 10 services, from running in the background to optimize your PC for gaming. Services running in the background often take up additional system resources, thereby hampering foreground activities, including gaming.\n\nTo disable background services, go to Settings -> Privacy -> Background Apps. Now switch off the \u2018Let apps run in the background\u2019 toggle in the right pane to prevent apps from using resources in the background. You can also keep the main toggle on and switch off individual apps if you want some apps to run in the background.\n\n8. Uninstall Redundant Programs and Bloatware\n\nWindows tends to get slower with each installed program. One way to speed up your Windows 10 computer and reduce lag is to uninstall programs you no longer use. It improves your PC\u2019s speed as well as power efficiency.\n\nTo uninstall programs, go to Control Panel -> Programs and Features. Now select the app or program you want to uninstall and hit the \u2018Uninstall\u2019 button at the top. Confirm your choice to remove the app from your PC.\n\nNote: You can also uninstall apps from Settings -> Apps -> Apps and Features. Just scroll down once you reach Apps and Features, click on the program you want to uninstall, and hit the \u2018Uninstall\u2019 button.\n\n9. Optimize Power Settings\n\nSome power settings can throttle the CPU irrespective of whether you are using a laptop or a desktop. So selecting a performance-oriented power plan can optimize your Windows 10 PC for gaming.\n\nTo do that, right-click on the battery symbol on the notification tray and select Power Options. On desktops, you can open the power settings menu from Control Panel -> Power Options. Now click on \u2018Show additional plans\u2019 and enable a high-performance plan.\n\nNote: If you don\u2019t see the \u2018Show additional plans\u2019 option, click on \u2018Create a power plan\u2019 in the left sidebar and then select \u2018High Performance\u2019. You can always tweak the options to your requirement.\n\nIf you\u2019re using a laptop, you can also tweak your power settings directly from the battery icon on the system tray. To do that, click on the icon and drag the slider over to the \u2018Best performance\u2019 option.\n\n10. Disable Mouse Acceleration\n\nMouse acceleration (Microsoft calls it Pointer Precision) helps you while working with text editors and navigating between GUI elements in Windows and other programs. However, it can adversely impact how your mouse performs in games. Disabling this can help optimize gaming in Windows 10. To do that, go to Control Panel -> Mouse -> Pointer Options. Now de-select the \u2018Enhance Pointer Precision\u2019 checkbox. Click Apply or OK, and you are done.\n\n11. Tweak Your Nvidia Control Panel or Radeon Control Center\n\nGraphics drivers from Nvidia and AMD come with their own control panels that let you tweak the graphics settings. For demo purposes, we are using the Nvidia Control Panel, but you can also tweak the corresponding options in the AMD software for similar results.\n\nTo access the Nvidia control panel, right-click on an open space on your desktop and select Nvidia Control Panel. Now click on \u2018Manage 3D Settings\u2018 on the left sidebar to change the following settings to optimize your Windows 10 PC for gaming:\n\nMaximum Pre-Rendered Frames: This setting controls the number of frames that the processor prepares before transferring them to the graphics card. Increasing this value generally results in smoother gameplay. However, you may notice some lag if you use your mouse and keyboard for gaming. To eliminate lag, set this to \u201c1\u201c.\n\nThreaded Optimization: This option enables multi-threaded optimization for modern multi-core processors, and hence, should always be \u2018On\u2018.\n\nVertical Sync: We have already discussed VSync and its importance in gaming in great detail, so check that out if you want to know more. For now, it would suffice to say that keeping it \u2018On\u2019 is generally a good idea to prevent screen-tearing and other annoying graphics glitches. However, disabling it allows games to run more smoothly in some cases. Disable VSync only if your monitor has a higher frame rate than your gameplay.\n\n12. Disable Steam Auto-updates\n\nSteam automatically updates all your games, thereby eating up valuable resources, including processing power, memory, and internet bandwidth. To prevent Steam from updating games in the background while you are playing, go to Steam -> Settings -> Downloads. Make sure that \u2018Allow downloads during gameplay\u2018 is unchecked. This setting is \u2018Off\u2019 by default, so make sure that it stays that way.\n\n13. Tweak Visual Effects Settings in Windows 10\n\nGUI animations can be a hindrance to the performance of your PC, thereby preventing you from getting the highest FPS in demanding games. By default, Windows 10 appearance settings are tuned towards aesthetics, but turning them off will help improve performance.\n\nYou can disable all these UI animations and shadows to optimize Windows 10 for gaming performance. To do it, go to System Properties -> Advanced tab -> Performance Settings -> Visual Effects. Now select the \u2018Adjust for best performance\u2019 option, and hit Apply or OK.\n\n14. Disable Nagle\u2019s Algorithm\n\nNagle\u2019s algorithm improves internet connection by reducing the number of packets that need to be sent over the network. It is helpful for slower connections but can contribute to latency issues when playing online games.\n\nWith modern internet connections often running into hundreds of Megabits per second, it\u2019s for the best that you disable it to reduce latency. That should better optimize your Windows 10 computer for gaming. To do it, go to Windows PowerShell -> enter \u2018ipconfig\u2018 (without quotes) -> and note your IPv4 address.\n\nNow open Windows Registry Editor (regedit) and navigate to the following folder: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\Interfaces . You will see several sub-folders here. Click through each to find the \u2018DhcpIPAddress\u2018 value in the right pane that matches your IP address.\n\nOnce you find the correct folder with your IP address as the DhcpIPAddress value, right-click and create a new DWORD (32-bit) Value in the same folder. Then, name it \u2018TcpAckFrequency\u2018 (without quotes). Give it a value of \u20181\u2019. Repeat the process for a second entry named \u2018TCPNoDelay\u2018 with a value of \u20181\u2019. Restart your PC, and Nagle\u2019s algorithm will be disabled for good. Any time you want to reverse the decision, delete the two keys you just created.\n\n15. Defrag Your Hard Drive (HDD-only)\n\nAnother easy way to improve access time for Windows apps is to defrag your hard drive. Windows 10 offers a built-in defragment option, and you can access it by searching for \u2018Defrag\u2019 in the Windows Search Box. You can also download and install Piriform\u2019s Defraggler (Free) for more power-user options. Do remember that de-fragmentation is only suitable for mechanical HDDs. You should never defrag SSDs because that reduces their lifespan.\n\n16. Install/ Update DirectX 12\n\nDirectX is a key element of the gaming experience on Windows 10. DirectX 12 is the latest version of the API tool, and it offers support for multiple GPU and CPU cores, better frame rates, lower power consumption, and enhanced graphical effects.\n\nWindows updates generally keep the DirectX version updated, but make sure you check it manually by hopping over to the DirectX diagnostic tool. To do that, open the Run dialog box (Windows key + R), type in \u2018dxdiag\u2019 (without quotes), and hit Enter. You can now check your DirectX version.\n\n17. Turn Off Accessibility Key Combinations\n\nNothing is more annoying than accidentally opening up warning windows while playing your favorite game. \u2018Sticky keys\u2019 can be a helpful accessibility feature, but it can also be a huge pain while gaming. That\u2019s why we recommend turning off accessibility key combinations when gaming.\n\nTo do that, go to Settings -> Ease of Access -> Keyboard (left sidebar). Now move over to the right pane and make sure that the toggles for the following settings are turned \u2018Off\u2019: \u2018Use Sticky Keys\u2019, \u2018Use Toggle Keys\u2019, and \u2018Use Filter Keys\u2019. Finally, scroll down to the bottom and uncheck the two following options:\n\nShow a warning message when turning on Sticky Keys, Toggle Keys, or Filter Keys from the keyboard\n\nMake a sound when turning Sticky Keys, Toggle Keys, or Filter Keys on or off from the keyboard\n\n18. Select the Correct GPU as Default for Gaming\n\nIn multi-GPU computers running Windows 10, you can manually specify which graphics card a Windows app/ game should use as default to enhance performance. So setting the high-end dedicated graphics card as the default for your games will optimize gaming performance on your Windows 10 PC. We have already discussed the subject in great detail, so check out our dedicated article on how to set default GPU for games and apps in Windows 10.\n\n19. Overclock Your GPU Using MSI Afterburner\n\nMSI Afterburner (Free) is one of the most popular free software to tune GPU settings. It is reliable, works on graphics cards from all brands (including non-MSI), and lets you monitor your hardware in real-time.\n\nIt not only lets you overclock your graphics card by increasing its clock frequency and voltage but also offers a fan speed control for the right balance between performance and temperature. MSI Afterburner\u2019s OS Scanner feature helps automatically find the highest stable overclock settings for your card, giving you a smooth experience with higher FPS in even the most demanding games. For more details, check out our detailed guide on how to overclock your GPU using MSI Afterburner.\n\n20. Keep Your PC Cool to Prevent Thermal Throttling\n\nOne of the biggest reasons for frame drops and laggy-ness in games is overheating. And one of the biggest causes of excess heating in PCs is a build-up of dust and cobwebs on the fans and other components inside your case. It can inhibit airflow, which is essential for the efficient cooling of any semiconductor chip, including the CPU, GPU, and RAM in your PC.\n\nTo prevent your PC from hanging or slowing down frequently, you will need to maintain its optimal thermal range. For that, you need to take several steps, like cleaning your case (or cabinet) regularly with canned air, a cloth, and ethyl alcohol. Check out our dedicated article on how to maintain optimal CPU temperature to know more on the subject.\n\nHardware Upgrades to Improve Gaming Performance in Windows 10\n\nAlongside the software tweaks and fixes mentioned above, you can also make a few changes to your PC components and network equipment. Here are some of the key changes we recommend:\n\n21. Ensure Optimum Broadband Speed and Latency\n\nA slow internet connection with high latency can cause lag and slower response times in games. While a fast, low-latency broadband connection won\u2019t increase your FPS, it will help reduce lag, thereby improving response times and increasing gaming performance.\n\nSo check the quality of your broadband connection, and if it isn\u2019t fast enough or has high ping times to the server of your favorite game, dump it for something better. You can test your internet speed on Ookla, Fast.com, Google, and many other sites and apps. You can also employ a Wi-Fi mesh network or upgrade to Wi-Fi 6/6E routers to ensure optimum speeds.\n\n22. Upgrade Your Graphics Card\n\nOne of the best ways to upgrade your gaming experience is to upgrade your graphics card. While they can be expensive, having faster GPUs can improve your FPS count significantly, resulting in much smoother gameplay. If your power supply (PSU) permits, you can also add a second unit of your existing GPU (in SLI or Crossfire) to create a multi-GPU setup for enhanced gaming performance.\n\n23. Upgrade to an SSD\n\nWith SSD prices hitting all-time lows, there\u2019s no good reason not to ditch mechanical hard drives for good. That\u2019s especially true if you are a gamer, given the massive performance gains offered by solid-state drives in terms of read/ write speeds. They not only deliver faster Windows 10 boot times and lightning-fast access to programs, but they also improve your overall gaming performance significantly. Check out the best budget gaming SSDs you can buy in 2021.\n\n24. Add More RAM\n\nWhether you are upgrading your existing computer or building a new one from the ground up, RAM is one of the essential components that could make or break your rig. With modern games getting more RAM-hungry than ever, adding more RAM can significantly optimize your Windows 10 gaming rig.\n\nAs of March 2021, you can easily get a 16GB 3200MHz DDR4 RAM kit without any fancy lighting for under $100. However, fancy modules with RGB and tighter timings can cost significantly more. Check out the best RAM for gaming at all price points.\n\n25. Reinstall Windows or Get a New PC!\n\nThis is the nuclear option, the last resort. If nothing else works, chances are, your PC is too old to run modern games with high hardware requirements. So a complete overhaul may be to get the best gaming performance out of your Windows 10 computer. It may cost you a pretty penny but will offer you the best experience.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure about dropping a large chunk of change on shiny new hardware, reinstall Windows 10 to see if that helps optimize your PC for gaming. Sometimes, years of abuse and neglect can mess up Windows installations beyond repair, and a reinstallation may fix that. This way, you can get better performance without spending a penny.\n\nGet the Best Out of Your Windows 10 Gaming Rig with These Simple Fixes\n\nDespite increased support for macOS and Linux from game developers, Windows 10 is the go-to choice for most PC gamers worldwide. However, the OS still has a few issues that you need to iron out before it offers you optimal gaming performance. So use this in-depth guide to optimize your Windows 10 computer for the best gaming performance. Once you have done that, check out the best tips and tricks to speed up Windows 10, the best ways to improve battery life of your Windows 10 laptop, and the best mechanical keyboards for gaming.",

        "title": "asus expertbook review: Asus ExpertBook B9 (B9400) review: Feather-light, shines bright",
        "text": "critic rating 3.5\n\nTop Features Light and sturdy Non-reflective display Rich, surround sound\n\nThe Asus ExpertBook B9 (B9400) is the Taiwanese company\u2019s latest laptop meant for business users. The 14-inch device that we reviewed comes powered by an 11th Gen Intel Evo Core-i7 processor, with 16GB LPDDR4X RAM in a light, thin frame. Its price starts at Rs 1,15,489, excluding the taxes. Here are our key takeaways on the business laptop to help you make your mind.\n\n\n\nAsus ExpertBook B9 (B9400): Design and display\n\nThe 14-inch Asus ExpertBook B9 (B9400) comes in a very lightweight build and can be easily lifted and held by one hand. The ExpertBook B9 weighs less than 1kg, actually just 880 grams. It has a thin profile also, being 14.9mm thin.\n\nThe chassis of the laptop also lifts a little from the side of the hinge as you open the lid, so that the laptop opens at an obtuse angle at the hinge, thus leaving a small space open below the chassis across the length of the laptop. This is meant to help the sound from the inbuilt speakers travel better and feel richer to the ears and also in dissipating the heat build-up. To give you a better idea, the display of the laptop is slightly elongated near the hinge, observed only when you open up the laptop, and with such a design, does not appear to be joined directly in the middle where the display and the chassis should conventionally meet. This is what Asus calls an \u2018ErgoLift Hinge\u2019.\n\nThe body of the Asus ExpertBook B9 is made of a Lithium-Magnesium alloy and is entirely in a matte finish, including the display. The lid of the laptop opens quickly with one hand, be it on a table or the bed. The hinge is a 180-degree lay-flat type, meaning the laptop can easily be opened like a broad slate on a table for everyone on the table to view the screen during a business meeting. This option would be appreciated once life, hopefully, goes back to normal and we can say goodbye to virtual office meetings.\n\nComing to the physical connectivity options, there are four on the left edge of the chassis: two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports, an HDMI port and an RJ45 via micro HDMI.\n\nOn the right edge, the laptop gives you a 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A port and a Kensington lock slot.\n\nThe laptop comes with a spill-resistant, backlit keyboard whose keys make a very less noticeable sound while typing. The key travel is about 1.4mm. The Asus NumberPad10 is an LED-illuminated numeric keypad that can be activated by pressing its icon in the top right corner of the touchpad.\n\nThe design of the Asus ExpertBook B9 will be most appreciated for the laptop\u2019s lightweight factor and may be criticised for its alloy body that has chances of getting ruptured if the laptop falls from a table or a heavy object somehow falls on the laptop, though the company claims that the ExpertBook B9 (B9400) has got MIL-STD 810H US military certification, with it passing several tests like Panel Pressure Test (can endure 30 kg force on lid and bottom without LCD panel damage), Shock Test, Drop Test (\u201c120 cm drop while powered on to mimic desk accident\u201d), Humidity and Altitude Test etc.\n\nThe ExpertBook B9 features a 14-inch non-reflective Full HD display with a matte finish. Against the light in an artificially lit environment, the display does not reflect the background at all, which is a big plus. The display panel is thin but feels sturdy enough. Many a time, when you lift the laptop with one hand, holding it from the chassis with the display open, it could tilt back slightly. Not to be advised but we tried that any way to see how the chassis takes on the weight of the display. There are 4mm thick bezels on the sides of the display panel.\n\n\n\nAsus ExpertBook B9 (B9400): Performance\n\nThe business laptop that we reviewed comes powered by a 2.80GHz 11th Gen Intel Evo Core-i7 processor (12M Cache, up to 4.7 GHz, 4 cores) coupled with 16GB LPDDR4X 4266 MHz RAM, though the RAM is expandable to 32GB. It runs Windows 10 Pro operating system and supports Intel Iris Xe graphics and RAID technology. It also comes with support for up to Wi-Fi 6 802.11ax.\n\nAsus has thought of and taken care of some small functionalities that are needed nevertheless in pandemic-affected work life. The keyboard comes with dedicated buttons for taking screenshots and to switch the mic on or off. There is a physical toggle to shut off the webcam if you want. There are a total of four microphones in the laptop to help you carry your spoken input clearly in a virtual meeting\n\nThe proximity sensor in the device wakes up the display when you come back to the desk from a break; if you are within a metre of the laptop, the display will wake up. A few times, the proximity sensor recognised that I was nearby when I just went past it to attend to something else. All in all, it is a nice little help for business users with a lot on their minds at all times.\n\nThe device starts warming up while charging and we found that it could grow uncomfortable for someone typing on it at the same time, particularly on the left side of the keyboard. However, the temperature of the chassis rises during charging but does not soar so as to render the surface of the keys impossibly hot. As soon as the device gets charged fully, which it does in about 90-100 minutes, the typing is more manageable.\n\nThe battery on the device lasts for a good 5-6 hours if you are working on some graphics-heavy application, otherwise, we would give you about 7 hours of usage on light applications like Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, Excel, Google Docs etc. The battery drains off quite fast after it reaches about 17%, petering out of juice within 15-20 minutes in an idle state. If you are working on some application, it will take 10-15 minutes to discharge completely.\n\nThe RAM could handle over 30 Google Chrome tabs, opened simultaneously, with a slight 5-6 seconds delay in loading some of them. On top of that, a 1080p video on YouTube loaded speedily.\n\nWhile Asus claims that you could use the touchpad to \u201ccontrol the cursor\u201d even when the LED-illuminated numeric keypad is turned on, we found it a little difficult to select something on the screen and more importantly, to register the click as we had to look for the right place on the touchpad to tap or double tap for the desired function to take effect. Moving the cursor is smooth, sure, but tapping and selecting is difficult while the numeric keypad is turned on.\n\nThe audio performance of the Asus ExpertBook B9 is stellar, with a surround sound effect. Asus says it has used a smart-amplifier technology paired with Harman/Kardon-certified speakers in the unit. The raised chassis, which is made possible by the \u2018ErgoLift Hinge\u2019 makes the sound spread more easily than it would in a flat chassis. The audio output on speakers is loud also; we played some music on YouTube and the sound filled the room at about 60-70% of volume only. Also, there is minimal distortion at high volume levels if you are playing some soothing, electronic track. You would enjoy listening to soft music on this laptop and we can even recommend it for watching a film or two. The laptop comes with Cortana and Alexa voice-recognition support. For the audio in the ExpertBook B9, Asus gets top marks.\n\nVerdict\n\nThe Asus ExpertBook B9 (B9400) is a well-rounded business laptop. It is feather-light, has a sturdy, alloy build with an ErgoLift Hinge, the display is full HD, non-reflective one, the connectivity options are plenty and the performance fast on some heavy load, with a few ifs and buts. All in all, if you are looking for a lightweight Windows laptop that is built for a seamless work experience, the Asus ExpertBook B9 (B9400) is a formidable choice.\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin",

Musk has touted Dogecoin on his Twitter account, and the cryptocurrency's value has soared ahead of his appearance.\n\n\"I'm a wild card, no telling what I might do,\" Musk, wearing a black bandana, joked in a brief promotional video for the show alongside Saturday's musical guest,\n\n.\n\n\"Same here,\" Cyrus said. \"Rules? No thanks.\"\n\nMusk has been in New York this week preparing for the appearance.

Musk has mused about using nuclear weapons to reshape the Red Planet for human habitation.\n\nSome \"\n\n\" cast members have expressed displeasure at the show's decision to give its platform to one of the world's richest people. Musk's appearance has drawn comparisons to the show's controversial decision in 2015 to invite\n\nto host as he was preparing for his presidential run.\n\nAlthough it is rare for a business executive to host \"SNL,\" South Africa-born Musk, 49, is no stranger to pop culture or comedy.\n\nHe has appeared on \"The Simpsons,\" \"Rick and Morty,\" and \"South Park,\" and dates a pop star, Canadian singer Grimes. Musk's persona helped inspire Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of superhero Iron Man in a series of Marvel films.\n\nHis humor also shows in the names of Tesla car models S, 3, X and Y (\"sexy\"). He once built and sold flamethrowers to promote his tunnel venture, the Boring Company. In 2018, Musk smoked marijuana on a live web show, and later offered $420 a share - a drug reference - to take Tesla private.\n\nWhile Musk has been getting ready for the cameras, Tesla has been in a rough patch.\n\nLongtime major shareholder Baillie Gifford disclosed it had sold 41% of its Tesla shares. Police in California are investigating a fatal accident in which a Tesla crashed into an overturned truck. Documents prepared by California regulators said Tesla executives do not believe Tesla can deliver the \"Full Self Driving\" autonomous vehicle technology this year, contradicting Musk's statements.",

In order to fix the issue, it has now introduced a 4-digit security code to make sure only those who have registered get the vaccine.\n\nThe government believes that the new 4-digit code will \u201creduce the opportunities of impersonation and wrongful use of flexibilities provided in\n\nfor facilitating vaccination coverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has been noticed in some instances that citizens that had booked their appointment for COVID vaccination through the CoWIN portal, but did not actually go for vaccination on the scheduled date, have received notification through SMS that a vaccine dose has been administered to them. Upon examination, it has been found to occur largely on account of the Vaccinator wrongly marking the citizen as vaccinated, i.e. an instance of a data entry error by the vaccinator,\u201d said the\n\nin a statement to the media.\n\nFrom May 8, all registration on the CoWin system will come with a \u201c4 digit security code\u201d to ensure that the correct data entry is made and the vaccine is given to people those who have registered for it.\n\nThe \u201c4-digit security code\u201d will be printed in the appointment acknowledgement slip and will not be known to the vaccinator. The four-digit code will also be sent in the confirmation SMS sent to the beneficiary after successful booking of appointment. \u201cThe Appointment Acknowledgement slip can also be saved and shown from the mobile,\u201d said the ministry.\n\n\u201cThis will ensure that, for such citizens who have booked an online appointment, the data entries regarding vaccination status of a citizen, are recorded correctly and only for those who book online appointment and avail the services at the center where they have booked the appointment,\u201d it explained.\n\n\n\nRead More:\n\nNew guidelines for vaccination which you must take note:\n\nYou have to carry a copy (digital or physical) of the appointment slip and/or the registered mobile phone with appointment confirmation SMS, so that the 4-digit security code can be furnished for easy completion of vaccination recording process.\n\nThe security code may be needed to be shown to the verifier or vaccinator before the vaccine dose has been administered. This is important as the digital certificate would be generated after the vaccine dose administration.\n\nAlso, you will get a confirmation SMS after the process has been successfully completed. The confirmation SMS indicates that the vaccination process has been completed successfully and the digital certificate has been generated. If one does not get the confirmation SMS, one should get in touch with the vaccinator/ vaccination center in-charge.\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin\n\nTop Comment",

Even applications from some Indian firms, which bring in some finished products from China, are awaiting WPC approval, the sources added.\n\nDell, HP, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and Lenovo did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe communications ministry did not respond to a request for comment either. And both sources said the government had still to respond to representations made by industry lobby groups and individual companies.\n\nIndia's hard stance on Chinese imports comes amid Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call for greater economic self-reliance.\n\nHis nationalist policies have helped boost the growth of smartphone assembly in the South Asian nation, and the sources believe the government's intention is to persuade companies to locate more of their production of electronic devices in India.\n\n\"The government's idea is to push companies to manufacture these products in India,\" one of the sources said.\n\n\"But tech companies are caught in a difficult situation - making in India would mean big-ticket investments and a long wait for returns, on the other hand the government-imposed hurdle on imports means a potential loss of revenues.\"\n\nIndia previously allowed companies to self-declare wireless equipment, a move that made imports easier, but new rules in March 2019 mandated firms to seek government approval.\n\nWhile India's market and export potential have turned it into the world's second-biggest mobile maker, tech analysts and industry insiders say it does not yet have the size or scale for companies to invest big in making IT products and smart wearable devices.\n\nWARY OF CHINA TECH\n\nThe long delay in WPC approvals also underscores India's strategy to cut China's influence in its tech economy, especially after a border clash with Beijing last year though tensions have eased since.\n\nModi's government this week omitted Chinese gearmaker\n\nfrom a list of participants in its 5G trials, though European and Korean rivals were permitted.\n\nAnd once 5G deployment begins in India, New Delhi will likely block mobile carriers from using Huawei's telecoms gear, Reuters previously reported.\n\nU.S. firms\n\n, Cisco and Dell were last year caught up in India's border tensions with China, as Indian ports held up imports of their products from China.\n\nIn another example, reported by Reuters late last year, India's tight control of quality clearances for electronic goods from China slowed the import of an Apple iPhone model.\n\nNow that firms have obtained safety clearances from India's quality control agency, getting WPC approval has become the main obstacle to importing electronic devices from China.",

It said it now expects second-quarter patent licensing revenue to be 2 billion crowns ($237 million) to 2.5 billion crowns.\n\nThe settlement, which ends ongoing lawsuits in several countries, was done in record time as patent disputes between technology companies can often take years to settle.\n\nThe current dispute started in December, while the last tussle between the two companies was in 2012 and took two years to resolve.\n\nThe cross-licence agreement covers sales of network infrastructure and handsets from Jan. 1, 2021, it said in a statement. The companies declined to disclose the terms citing confidentiality.\n\nEricsson invests about 40 billion crowns every year in research and has a portfolio of more than 57,000 patents.\n\nIts Nordic rival\n\n, which also has a substantial patent portfolio, settled a patent issue with Samsung earlier this year.\n\nIn the first quarter, Ericsson's patent licensing revenue fell to 0.8 billion crowns from 2.5 billion crowns a year earlier. Royalties from its patent portfolio account for roughly a third of Ericsson's operating profit.\n\nEricsson said its patent revenue continue to be affected by factors such as expired licence agreements pending renewal, geopolitical impacts on the handset market, a technology shift from 4G to 5G, and possible currency effects going forward.\n\nIt still has an ongoing dispute with Dutch telecom company KPN NV, which last month filed a patent-infringement complaint against Ericsson in a district court in Texas.",

Think noise-canceling but bump-canceling, if you will.\"\n\nOff-white materials and a back mirror make the pod seem bigger and more \"inviting\" for new users, Giegel said.\n\n\"This pod was really the embodiment of 'How do we take something that's an idea and make it into something that's a reality for us to sit in?'

It could be the first form of transport in 100 years to revolutionize travel, just like cars, trains and planes did, Giegel said.\n\nRocket scientist Robert Goddard came up with the \"vactrain\" idea in the early 1900s.

Giegel, who worked at Musk's SpaceX at the time, said technology is now catching up.\n\nThe required batteries, power electronics and some sensors were previously not quite ready, Giegel said. \"We're at like the very bleeding edge of what a high-speed autonomous battery-powered vehicle is.\"\n\nVirgin Hyperloop is looking to first develop passenger routes in India, where the transport system is overloaded, and in Saudi Arabia, which lacks an infrastructure.\n\n\"It starts off with two people riding a Hyperloop.

        "text": "Mumbai: Food delivery app\n\nis in talks to\n\naround $100 million in e-grocer\n\n, two people in the know told ET, after discussions of a possible merger between the two fell through last year at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nZomato\u2019s investment is likely part of a larger financing round and may value the Gurugram-based online\n\nfirm at around $1 billion, sources said. This time the talks have centred around a capital infusion, unlike last year when Zomato would have likely acquired Grofers in an all-stock deal.\n\n\u201cZomato has ambitions in the grocery segment and wants to partner with a specialty grocery company rather than build something of its own...They want to stay focussed on the food business,\u201d a person privy to the deal details said on the condition of anonymity as the talks are private.\n\nGrofers \u2014 which was looking to list on the tech-heavy Nasdaq in the US through a Cantor Fitzgerald blank check firm, as reported first by ET on February 24 \u2014 is expected to scrap the\n\nplan and continue to remain private, said another person in the know.\n\nVision Fund (SVF), the largest shareholder in Grofers with an about 50% stake, was earlier steering conversations around its initial public offering via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC).\n\nGraphic: Rahul Awasthi\n\nGrofers said in an emailed response to ET, \u201cWe are in regular touch with the investor ecosystem and are seeing a lot of inbound interest given grocery is an essential need and a high growth segment. Given the dynamic business environment, there will always be room for speculation, but our team is focused on serving more families.\u201d\n\nThe Grofers spokesperson added that the company is witnessing a year-on-year growth of around 110%.\n\nZomato did not comment till press time Thursday.\n\nSecond shot\n\nZomato\u2019s investment in Grofers comes at a time when SVF is close to deploying $450 million in rival Swiggy, ET had reported on April 15, largely to help the restaurant aggregator expand its services beyond food delivery.\n\nSwiggy has been pushing its quick grocery delivery service Instamart and daily essentials delivery platform Supr Daily in an attempt to diversify.\n\nSoftBank with a successful DoorDash IPO in the US under its belt and GoPuff\u2019s valuation soaring to $8.9 billion has seen the on-demand delivery category clock good returns for its portfolio firms globally.\n\nZomato, which experimented with grocery delivery during the initial months of the pandemic, discontinued its services under Zomato Market saying it was not core to its business. \u201cWe did grocery because the food delivery business was gone during the lockdown. For 3-6 months, it worked really well and helped us get through the crisis. Eventually, it didn\u2019t make sense\u2026,\u201d Deepinder Goyal, cofounder and CEO of Zomato, told ET in an interview in March this year.\n\nOn April 28, Zomato filed its IPO prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India, seeking to raise more than $1 billion through a combination of fresh equity and sale of existing shares.\n\nZomato said it intends to garner Rs 8,250 crore (about $1.1 billion) through its public listing.\n\nThe Deepinder Goyal-led company had stated in its IPO filing that acquisitions will be a key strategy for the firm. While grocery is a low-margin business, Zomato\u2019s investment in Grofers may help it scale the vertical quickly by combining forces in a highly competitive sector which has large players like Amazon, BigBasket-Tata, Flipkart and Reliance JioMart, with deep pockets. Now, it will also take on Swiggy which has unveiled a strategy to go big on grocery.\n\nCompetition hots up\n\nAs for Grofers, the latest investment round will help it build a much-needed war chest in a market seeing increased competition and a massive surge in demand on the back of the Covid-19 second wave.\n\nCompetition in the segment has turned fierce, most recently with the Competition Commission of India approving\n\n\u2019 proposal to acquire a majority stake in grocery e-tailer BigBasket, the leader in the segment.\n\n\u201cNow that the company has decided to shelve its IPO, it is looking to mop up around $200 million,\u201d another person in the know said.\n\nET could not immediately ascertain the other investors that are likely to join Zomato in Grofers\u2019 funding round.\n\nThe online grocer had been eyeing between $400 million and $500 million through a listing on the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which was scheduled for this month at a possible valuation of more than $1 billion, ET had reported.\n\nGrofers would have merged with one of Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s SPAC vehicles. The New York-based non-bank is led by the India-born former co-chief executive of Deutsche Bank, Anshu Jain who is its president.\n\nGrofers recently said it is currently at a run rate of $1 billion in annual gross merchandise value (GMV).\n\nFor financial year 2020, it registered revenue from operations of Rs 2,289 crore on Rs 1,181 crore in losses, news portal Entrackr had reported.\n\nRun rate is a term used to measure the financial performance of a company if its current results were to sustain in future as well.\n\nBigBasket has said that it crossed the $1 billion annual revenue run rate mark in September last year, buoyed by growing demand for online groceries due to the pandemic.\n\nBigBasket's business-to-business arm Supermarket Grocery Supplies recorded revenue of Rs 3,322 crore on a loss of Rs 611 crore for financial year 2019-20, regulatory documents sourced from business intelligence platform Paper.vc showed.\n\nInnovative Retail Concepts, which operates BigBasket\u2019s online retail business, posted revenue of Rs 3,418 crore on losses of Rs 424.3 crore in the same period.",

On Coinswitch Kuber average daily volumes have been around Rs 100 crore in the last two weeks.\n\nMost Indian crypto exchanges have listed the token, although some like ZebPay have steered away despite investor interest.\n\n\u201cWe may list it, but first I'd like to be sure it isn't just the Tulip Mania of the 21st century,\u201d said Vikram Rangala, COO of ZebPay, referring to one of the most infamous market bubbles and crashes of all time in the 1600s.\n\nUnlike other cryptocurrencies that are either in limited circulation \u2013 making them a storehouse of value - or have use cases like smart contracts, Doge\u2019s use cases have been limited to tipping on Twitter and Reddit for quality content.\n\nRead:\n\nIts official website describes the currency as \u201can open-source peer-to-peer digital currency, favoured by Shiba Inus worldwide.\u201d\n\nThere are over 129 billion Doge tokens in circulation, according to Coinmarketcap.com, and more can be mined.\n\nNithin Kamath, chief executive of online brokerage firm Zerodha, said a lack of regulations in crypto leaves the industry susceptible to manipulation, unlike strict regulations on capital markets that make it easier to track trading activities which artificially inflate the price of a stock.\n\n\u201cI can't really make any sense of what is happening with Dogecoin,\u201d Kamath said. \u201cWith no checks in place, the risks of some of the currencies like Dogecoin being a pump and dump scheme is quite high. I think the best way to play it is by not allocating more than 1%-5% of your liquid net worth to assets where the speculative activity is quite high,\u201d Kamath said.\n\nThe best way to protect investors from a risky asset class like Doge is to restrict trading of the asset to high net-worth individuals and blockchain experts, said Mathew Chacko, partner at Spice Route Legal.\n\nThe majority of crypto traders in\n\nare under 25.\n\nDogecoin users\n\nUsers say that if enough people ascribe value to the cryptocurrency, then the token ends up becoming valuable for that community, and use cases eventually arise.\n\n\u201cI don't want to sell my Dogecoins, whatever happens,\u201d said Siddharam Ishwarkatti, a 42-year-old engineer working for a multinational firm who started investing in cryptocurrency this year. \u201cEven if it goes to 100, I will not sell it. These currencies might have a future. Bitcoin had zero value when it started.\u201d\n\nDogecoin is an initiation token into the crypto universe for several new users like Ishwarkatti and 19-year-old Mrityunjaya Lala, who want to invest limited resources.\n\nThe fear of missing out and the thrill of owning a meme stock as well as the heavy influence of Tesla\u2019s Musk is driving many new traders to Dogecoin, even though they may not fully understand blockchain technology.\n\nPriyanshu Singh, a 19-year-old B Tech. student from Kanpur, is also hoping to use his profits from the Dogecoin rally to invest in more stable coins like Ethereum and Bitcoin eventually.\n\nLong-term believers in crypto's future and blockchain technology say that Dogecoin distracts people from the true value of crypto because it makes the industry about quick returns.\n\nGameStop Comparisons\n\nDogecoin has peaked and slumped in its almost 8 years of existence, depending on external influences such as a community of Dogecoin Redditors supporting Sochi Olympics players in 2014 who lacked funds, to influential people adopting and promoting the token.\n\nThe most recent peak was on January 28 when Musk tweeted a faux \u201cDogue\" magazine cover. Discussion on the cryptocurrency surged on WallStreetBets, the Reddit forum responsible for GameStop\u2019s stock price hike.\n\nSeveral industry experts have drawn parallels between the current surge in Doge's prices and the GameStop short squeeze earlier this year.\n\n\u201cI think Dogecoin, like GameStop, is one of those markers of social movements that are breaking age-old concepts of what defines money,\u201d said Tanvi Ratna, chief executive of think tank Policy 4.0. \u201cWhat appears like frivolous games are drawing serious amounts of real money and challenging ideas around the legitimacy of money always coming from the state. This dynamic worries most governments.\u201d\n\nThe now-famous GameStop short squeeze has propelled the stock of the video game retailer to nearly $160 as of Wednesday, rising by more than 30x year-to-date.\n\nRating agency S&P Global Ratings on Wednesday also raised the stock\u2019s credit rating from B- to B.\n\n\u201cWhile the risks associated with investing in Dogecoin are many, the framework does not provide legally viable recourse,\u201d said Anu Monga, Partner, AnantLaw, and an expert in technology regulations. \u201cOwing to the volatility of Dogecoin, the financial regulator of the UK has clearly warned people investing in crypto assets such as Dogecoin to do so at their own risk.\u201d\n\nCurrently, in India, there is no legal framework to address private cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021, which provides for an official digital currency to be floated by the RBI, is under consideration by the government.",

Basically, with coronavirus we have seen the supply chain disruptions. If you are depending on so many different parts of the world, things happen. And if you don't get your chip, the whole industry shuts down\u2026\u201d Khare said.\n\nIndia needs to focus on building some aspects of\n\nwithin the country, and IBM is willing to partner with Indian officials in this regard, he added.\n\nThe government, which has pushed domestic manufacturing in electronics and mobile phones through various incentive schemes, had earlier invited firms to set up semiconductor manufacturing facilities.\n\nKhare did not, however, comment on whether IBM would look at India as one of its manufacturing destinations in future.\n\nOn Thursday, IBM announced the development of the world\u2019s first chip with 2-nanometre (nm) nanosheet technology, which is projected to achieve 45% higher performance, or 75% lower energy use than today\u2019s most advanced 7-nm node chips.\n\nThe\n\nis expected to reach manufacturing supply chains by 2024, said Khare.\n\nThe advanced chip is expected to quadruple cell phone battery life, only requiring users to charge their\n\nonce every four days and significantly slash the carbon footprint of data centres, which account for 1% of global energy use.\n\nIt will also significantly speed up laptop functions, leading to faster processing of applications and assisting in language translation, along with faster internet access. It is also expected to speed up object detection and reaction time in autonomous vehicles like self-driving cars.\n\nWith the advent of artificial intelligence, the computing requirement is doubling every three and a half months, said Khare.\n\n\u201cThat is just an unsustainable need of compute power, and that's where this chip will be very helpful,\u201d he added.\n\nKhare also said that the new chip will accelerate the discovery process of new drugs by 10-20 times, which will be helpful in dealing with situations such as the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThat's where we will start to see the value of this type of innovation... The two very important points are AI, and discovery of new materials, new drugs, because those require significant compute capability,\u201d he said.\n\nDeveloped less than four years after IBM announced its milestone 5-nm design, the new 2-nm chip will fit up to 50 billion transistors on a chip the size of a fingernail.",

        "text": "Market trackers have cut their annual growth estimates of the\n\noffline channel, as the raging pandemic has forced bricks-and-mortar stores including organised retail outlets to either shut shop or curtail operations. Offline retailers said they are staring at about 50,000\n\nlosses as a result.\n\nThe development may also force top brands to delay their offline expansion plans, according to experts.\n\nCounterpoint Research said offline retail, which saw stellar growth in the past couple of quarters, will account for 55% of the smartphone market in 2021, compared with the initial estimate of 60%, and warned that it could fall even lower, depending on the duration of the second wave.\n\nStrategy Analytics said offline sales could drop below 50% in upcoming quarters, pegging the full-year offline sales at 52% of the total volume.\n\n\u201cThe smartphone market is to witness a degrowth in the second quarter and the brunt of it will be borne by the offline retail channel, whereas e-commerce which is ever-expanding to newer pin codes clearly has an advantage,\u201d said Rajeev Nair, senior analyst at Strategy Analytics.\n\nAlthough bricks-and-mortar retailers had been reeling under the pressure of increasing penetration of e-commerce for almost two years now, 2021 was believed to be a game changer for offline sales.\n\nThe channel bounced back strongly in the January-March period, recording its highest share of 58%, boosted by huge pent-up demand. But the second wave of Covid-19 is set to limit the offline channel\u2019s growth momentum, especially since it is unlikely to see as much pent-up demand this year as 2020.\n\n\u201cPrevious year's second quarter was a complete washout in sales, so in that sense this year business is still on, albeit at a slower pace,\u201d said a Mumbai-based store manager of a smartphone retailer, requesting not to be identified. \u201cBut we don\u2019t expect this year to bounce back as sharply as it did last time because smartphones have achieved a sizeable penetration by now and hence the possibility of a huge pent-up demand is remote.\u201d\n\nRavi Kumar, president, Karnataka Mobile Retailers Association, expects 2021 to be worse than 2020 for the offline channel.\n\nIndia has a network of 150,000 independent mom-and-pop stores, which are staring at a loss of almost 50,000 jobs since the outbreak of Covid-19 in India.\n\n\u201cTime and again, we are being pushed to the edge due to the unfair collusion between smartphone brands and e-commerce companies... losses are mounting every day and store boys are being sent to their homes without a penny,\u201d said Arvinder Khurana, president of the All-India Mobile Retailers\u2019 Association.\n\nThe setback to the offline channel has come just when top brands such as\n\n,\n\nand\n\n, besides the multi-brand retail chain Croma, were significantly expanding their retail network.\n\nXiaomi had announced that it would invest Rs 100 crore to double its exclusive offline stores from 3,000 in the next two years, whereas Vivo said it would add 130 stores in 2021. taking its total exclusive store count to more than 650. OnePlus said it would continue to expand its retail footprint \u2013 from 65 to 150 cities this year - with an investment outlay of Rs 100 crore for 2020 and 2021. Tata-owned Croma had planned to add 100 new stores by the end of this financial year, its highest-ever yearly store addition.\n\nBut the pandemic may delay companies' plans to double down on the offline channel, said experts.\n\nXiaomi, Vivo, OnePlus and Croma did not reply to ET\u2019s queries till press time.",

        "text": ", billionaire\n\n' rocket company, said on Wednesday it is targeting July 20 for its first suborbital sightseeing trip on its New Shepard\n\ncraft, a landmark moment in a competition to usher in a new era of private commercial space travel.\n\nBlue Origin also said it will offer one seat on the first flight to the winning bidder of a five-week online auction, the proceeds of which will be donated to the space firm's foundation.\n\nThe New Shepard rocket-and-capsule combo is designed to autonomously fly six passengers more than 62 miles (100 km) above Earth into suborbital space, high enough to experience a few minutes of weightlessness and see the curvature of the planet before the pressurized capsule returns to earth under parachutes.\n\nThe capsule features six observation windows Blue Origin says are nearly three times as tall as those on a\n\n747 jetliner and the largest ever used in space.\n\n\"The view will be spectacular,\" Blue Origin's Director of Astronaut Sales, Ariane Cornell, told a media briefing.\n\nAfter its first flight in July, Cornell said Blue Origin would have \"a couple more\" crewed flights before the end of the year. She declined to disclose details of the ticket price, which has been a closely guarded secret inside the company for years.\n\nReuters reported in 2018 that Blue Origin was planning to charge passengers at least $200,000 for the ride, based on an appraisal of rival plans from billionaire Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc and other considerations, though its thinking may have changed.\n\nWednesday's announcement follows years of testing and development work that has included delays.\n\nCornell said Blue Origin would \"love\" to increase the frequency of its tourist spaceflights and add launch locations, possibly outside the United States, depending on demand. For July's flight, the reusable New Shepard booster will launch and land in West Texas.\n\nCelebrities and the uber-rich appear to be the core market for space tourist jaunts, at least initially. Cornell told reporters the most likely candidates would be \"very clear on our radar.\"\n\nOnly 569 people had ever been into space, she said, adding that \"we're about to change that dramatically.\"\n\nBut she declined to say when - or if - Bezos, a lifelong space enthusiast and currently the world's richest person, will take a trip on New Shepard.\n\nVirgin Galactic also aims to fly private customers in early 2022, after a first flight with Branson on board later this year.\n\nIts zero-gravity experience is anchored by its SpaceShipTwo plane, and the company has ambitious plans to offer point-to-point travel between far-flung cities at near-space altitudes.\n\nVirgin says it will charge more than $250,000 for new reservations but has not announced final pricing. Sales will reopen following Branson's flight.\n\nMeanwhile, a college science professor and an aerospace data analyst are among a four-member crew for a launch into orbit planned later this year by\n\n's SpaceX, part of a charity drive billed as the first all-civilian spaceflight in history.\n\nBlue Origin has fallen far behind SpaceX on orbital transportation, and lost out to SpaceX and United Launch Alliance (ULA) on billions of dollars' worth of U.S. national security launch contracts which begin in 2022.\n\nBut its\n\nannouncement provides Bezos, who founded\n\n, needed momentum while it protests SpaceX's $2.9 billion contract under\n\n's high-profile program to return Americans to the moon in coming years.\n\nRegulatory filings revealed that Bezos sold\n\nshares worth about $2 billion this week as a part of an arranged trading plan. Bezos, who will step down as CEO in a few months, has been unloading shares of the company he founded and had also said he would sell shares worth $1 billion to fund Blue Origin projects.",

We want Spain to remain the EU's second-largest car producer in 2030, 2040 and 2050, regardless of the technology there is,\" said Raul Blanco, junior industry minister for Spain, also the world's eight largest carmaker.\n\nOf the 70 billion euros to be sent from Brussels in the form of grants, the Spanish government plans to spend 13 billion on sustainable mobility through 2023.\n\nThat will mostly be used to promote domestic sales of EVs, improve charging infrastructure and build its first battery cell plant for cars.\n\nIn one of the highest-profile uses of EU funds in Spain, the government in March announced a public-private partnership aimed at promoting electric vehicles, with a bidding process due to start around July and winners to be announced by year-end.\n\nThe project, in which central and regional governments may hold a stake, will cover the manufacturing of batteries and EVs in Spain, demand promotion for electric cars and the development of infrastructure to support them.\n\nA 40-gigawatt battery cell plant constructed as part of the project would cost over 2.5 billion euros, Blanco said.\n\nThe proposal has sparked competition among Spain's regions, with Catalonia offering land, public loans and aid to attract a battery plant, and neighbouring Aragon and Valencia also in contention.\n\nWhile few private sector bidders have yet publicly emerged, Volkswagen AG's Spanish SEAT brand and utility Iberdrola have formed an alliance to work on a bid.\n\nTheir involvement would fit within a wider project they are planning, covering all elements of EV production from mining to battery production to the manufacturing of a finished vehicle at SEAT's Catalonia assembly plant.\n\n\"The project is on the starting block. Its execution will hinge upon a clear commitment by the European Commission,\" SEAT's chairman Wayne Griffiths said in an emailed statement referring to the EU funds. \"Spain cannot miss this historic opportunity.\"\n\nSpanish firm Phi4tech, which has its own separate cell plant project in the Extremadura region tied to a lithium reserve that is among Europe's largest, is advising SEAT and Iberdrola on battery production.\n\nSTIFF COMPETITION\n\nThe Spanish government's plans to promote electromobility have convinced Renault and\n\n, which import batteries to the country, to announce new investments to build hybrid cars and engines.\n\nA Renault source and a Ford spokeswoman said they were monitoring battery-making projects in the country, a potential future source of components.\n\nMadrid is wooing Volkswagen, which makes electric vehicles in Germany and Slovakia, to choose Spain over France and Portugal for a southern Europe battery gigafactory by 2026. SEAT is also weighing whether to start producing 500,000 EVs a year at its Martorell plant outside Barcelona in 2025.\n\nBut Spain faces significant competition from elsewhere in Europe to attract carmakers looking to invest.\n\nIt got a jolt last year when\n\nannounced the closure of its three plants around Catalonia's capital Barcelona by end-2021, with the group shifting its production to France as part of its alliance with Renault.\n\nAuto parts makers Continental and Bosch are also closing factories nearby, with Bosch, according to unions, moving its production to Poland, where labour costs are lower.\n\nCatalonia's government business chief Ramon Tremosa said the recent layoffs could be offset if the northeastern region is chosen for a battery plant built with the help of EU funds for which, he added, \"big global companies\" have shown interest.\n\n\"If the Martorell plant does not get an electric car, its days are numbered,\" said Matias Carnero, a SEAT union leader who is also a member of VW's group supervision council.",

It helps ensure trust and security in transactions by not allowing any one party to make alterations to the data without everyone involved agreeing to it. In supply chains, it ensures transparency by enabling every party to trace the goods and ensure they are not being replaced or misused at any point.\n\nChina, Das says, is leading the world in the use and development of the technology. \u201cThe most patents related to blockchain in the world are filed by China, and some of the biggest names in the blockchain and cryptocurrency community are in Chinese firms,\u201d he says. China is using blockchain effectively in areas such as the financial sector, energy trading, and military applications. They are using it particularly, Das says, to strengthen the security of their networks.\n\nThe country\u2019s head start is said to be the result of its focus on cryptocurrency technologies, which is where blockchain originated. Das says countries that have been more open to cryptocurrency, such as the US and certain European countries, have seen more innovations around blockchain, and a robust research ecosystem.\n\nIndia, Das says, has a lot of catching up to do. \u201cSome of the research areas in blockchain involve cryptographic techniques, design of security protocols (for example, authenticated key agreement, access control and intrusion detection), design of consensus protocols, blockchain implementation and its real-time testbed experiments,\u201d he says.\n\nTo be able to innovate and conduct research in blockchain technologies, one should have knowledge of discrete mathematics, basics of algorithms, cryptography, and network & systems engineering To be able to innovate and conduct research in blockchain technologies, one should have knowledge of discrete mathematics, basics of algorithms, cryptography, and network & systems engineering\n\nCurrently, research in blockchain is largely limited to\n\ns and IIITs. But Das, who did his PhD from IIT Kharagpur, believes in the coming days, it will have to percolate down to other institutions because of the potentially wide applications of the technology.\n\nHe says in the last two years he has seen a rise in interest from young researchers in blockchain. \u201cTo be able to innovate and conduct research in blockchain technologies, one should have knowledge of discrete mathematics, basics of algorithms, cryptography and network & systems engineering. Researchers must also have basic knowledge of computer networks,\u201d he says.\n\nAt IIITH, Das and his research group are currently focusing on research in the \u2018Blockchain of Things\u2019 domain. The objective is to apply blockchain in areas such as internet-of-things (IoT), internet-of-drones, internet-of-vehicles, internet-of-medical-things, healthcare, smart farming, smart grids and supply chains.\n\n\u201cToday, everything is connected to the internet, and a large amount of data is generated. This data is mostly confidential or private. So, security becomes a big challenge. At the same time, storing the data in a single server is not reliable because of the possibility of the single server failing. Blockchain is used in such environments because blockchain is a distributed technology, and it provides transparency of the data, cryptographic protection of data, and immutability,\u201d Das says.",

She even remembers the patent grant number: 5266446.\n\nShe had just joined\n\n, after a\n\nin metallurgical engineering from\n\n, a\n\nin material science from\n\n, Illinois, and PhD from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, New York.\n\nShe says she had the good fortune to be placed in a group working on groundbreaking\n\n. They were developing a new thin film process to enhance communication between multiple processor dies on a ceramic packaging substrate. She found it very exciting, being straight out of school. But she was also intimidated by the others in the team, since they were all seasoned researchers.\n\nSince Mukta was the youngest, she was the one who would go into the development fab every day, run the hardware, evaluate it, inspect it. It gave her a real feel for the problem they were trying to solve.\n\nOnce when she was inspecting, she started noticing defects. \u201cIt struck me that there was a way of changing the process to make it simpler and less prone to defects. I documented what I thought was an improvement in structure and process. When this was reviewed by senior members of the team and the IP (intellectual property) legal team in IBM, they realised it was a very important idea. This eventually got into the final patent that IBM submitted in 1990,\u201d Mukta says.\n\nThe patent was granted three years later. And it went on to become a landmark patent in advanced packaging technology.\n\n\u201cIt shocked me to realise that it was possible for a 20 something, straight out of grad school, to add so much value to a key IBM patent. I also learnt at the time that it\u2019s important to pay close attention to problems. And try to figure out unique solutions. When you do that, it could lead to some really good inventions,\u201d says Mukta, who is today Distinguished Research Staff Member at IBM Research, US.\n\nStart with the assumption that you are capable of inventing.

IBM has recognised the Mumbai girl as a lifetime master inventor, a title that\u2019s not conferred easily.\n\nMukta says invention requires that you know the area well. \u201cYou need to immerse yourself in the area, figure out what the literature already has, ruminate on unsolved problems, look for new solutions, follow through,\u201d she says.\n\nShe also notes that almost all her inventions have co-authors. \u201cSmall teams of people, particularly if they have different training, experience, talent, they can give rise to exceptional ideas. You can feed off each other \u2013 someone with a background in physical chemistry can explain to me, a metallurgist, some nuance that I may not have immediately grasped,\u201d she says.",

Tencent also bought a majority stake in Riot Games in 2011 and acquired the rest of the company in 2015. Riot Games is the developer of \"League of Legends,\" one of the world's most popular desktop-based games.\n\nTencent is negotiating risk-mitigation measures with CFIUS so it can keep its investments, according to the sources. The details of the proposed measures could not be learned. They typically involve ringfencing the owner of a company from operations that have national security implications. They often call for the appointment of independent auditors to monitor the implementation of these agreements.\n\nOne of the sources said Epic Games has not been sharing any user data with Tencent.\n\nThe sources cautioned there is no certainty that Tencent will clinch deals to keep its investments and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.\n\nTencent, Epic Games and a CFIUS representative at the U.S. Treasury Department declined to comment.\n\nA Riot Games spokesman said the Los Angeles-based company operates independently of Tencent and that it has implemented \"industry-leading practices\" to protect player data. He declined to comment on Riot Games' discussions with CFIUS.\n\nCFIUS has been cracking down on Chinese ownership of U.S. technology assets in the last few years, amid an escalation in tensions between Washington and Beijing over trade, human rights and the protection of intellectual property. U.S. officials have expressed concerns that the personal data of U.S. citizens could end up in the hands of China's\n\ngovernment.\n\nPresident\n\n's administration has maintained the hawkish stance against China inherited in January from his predecessor Donald\n\n, albeit with more of a focus on geopolitical issues such as the future of Taiwan and Hong Kong, as well as China's persecution of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang.\n\nYet many key CFIUS roles have not yet been staffed. This has provided a reprieve to China's ByteDance, which was ordered by Trump last year to sell its popular short video app TikTok but balked at a transaction that would have involved Oracle Corp and Walmart Inc. CFIUS has not sought to enforce the divestiture order under Biden.\n\nEpic is locked in a legal fight with\n\nover access to the\n\nmaker's app store. It alleges that\n\nforces developers to use its in-app payment systems - which charge commissions of up to 30% - and to submit to app-review guidelines that discriminate against products that compete with Apple's own.\n\nApple argues that Epic Games broke their contract when it introduced its own in-app payment system in Fortnite to circumvent Apple's commissions. It says the way it runs the app store inspires trust in consumers to open up their wallets to unknown developers.\n\nTencent's vast businesses include video games, content streaming, social media, advertising and cloud services. China has in recent months sought to curb the economic and social power of Tencent and other internet companies such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, in a clampdown backed by President Xi Jinping. Reuters reported last week that Beijing was preparing a substantial antitrust fine for Tencent.",

The stock fell 3.4% during the regular session after the Biden administration blocked a Trump-era rule affecting gig workers.\n\nThe cost and speed of business recovery is of paramount interest to investors, and Uber executives on Wednesday said the take rate, the share Uber takes in fees from each ride, would drop from the previous quarter to a 20% range. Taking a lower cut will allow Uber drivers to earn more, but weigh on Uber's second-quarter mobility revenue and profitability.\n\nAtlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said shares fell after hours because of the pressure on the take rate and implicit driver incentives.\n\nThe food-delivery business continued to grow in the first quarter, but ride-hail bookings were flat from the previous quarter.\n\nMoreover, the ride-hailing mobility business had to absorb a $600 million hit to account for a settlement with its more than 70,000 UK drivers and provide them with more benefits.\n\n\"The company's bottom line has been hurt by the ruling in the UK which raised expenses and reminded investors that a similar move in the U.S. could have a much bigger impact,\" said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com.\n\nUber posted an adjusted $359 million first-quarter loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization - a metric that excludes one-time costs, including stock-based compensation, narrowing losses by nearly $100 million from the previous quarter.\n\nAnalysts on average had expected the company to report an adjusted\n\nloss of around $452 million, Refinitiv data showed.\n\nUber has promised to be profitable on that metric by the end of the year, three months after its smaller ride-hail rival Lyft Inc, which on Tuesday said it would report sustained adjusted profits starting in the third quarter.\n\nUber's chief financial officer, Nelson Chai, said on Wednesday the company would become profitable in the \"second half of the year,\" leaving the door open to achieving profits in the third quarter.\n\nRevenue at Uber's delivery segment, which includes its\n\nrestaurant delivery business, more than tripled from last year and grew 28% from last quarter to $1.7 billion.\n\nUber's ride-hail gross bookings, which plummeted over the last year due to the pandemic, remained roughly flat from the last quarter and down 38% from the previous year.\n\nSPRING REBOUND\n\nUber's first-quarter results come as the company reported record food delivery and rides bookings in March and April, as U.S. vaccination rates increased and temperatures warmed.\n\nBoth Uber and Lyft have struggled to serve the spring rebound in ride-hail trips, when consumer demand temporarily outstripped driver supply, leading to higher prices and longer wait times in some U.S. cities.\n\nUber in April said it would invest an additional $250 million to further boost driver earnings and offer payment guarantees in an effort to incentivize new and existing drivers. Those charges will further drag down second-quarter mobility results.\n\nExcluding the $600 million charge, Uber reported $3.5 billion in first-quarter revenue, ahead of an average analyst estimate for $3.29 billion, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nUber and Lyft's shares took a tumble last week when U.S.\n\nSecretary Marty Walsh told Reuters in an interview that \"a lot of gig workers should be classified as employees.\"\n\nUber Chief Legal Officer Tony West on a Wednesday conference call said the company was hopeful it will have a dialogue with the Biden administration Labor Department that \"can ultimately lead to a resolution.\"\n\nThe gig companies rely on low-cost flexible workers and say their services would become unavailable if workers were reclassified as employees.",

BigBasket had told ET earlier that it was seeing a 25% jump in orders in April, compared to demand in March.\n\nIndustry trackers say the demand has been on the up only in the past one month, as customers are seeing far higher service levels this year, compared to during the peak of the lockdown last year.\n\nMoreover, the sustained expansion in the base of online shoppers witnessed last year is leading to climbing demand this year.",

        "text": "New Delhi: As the Indian government renews its thrust on\n\nwith various incentive-linked schemes, the country has a great opportunity as well as required capabilities to establish a full-fledged semiconductor fabrication (FAB) electronics manufacturing ecosystem in the country, the India Cellular and Electronics Association (\n\n) said on Wednesday.\n\nIndia's share in the\n\nhas grown from 1.3 per cent in 2012 to 3.6 per cent in 2019. Domestic electronics manufacturing has increased substantially from Rs 1.90 lakh crore in 2014-15 to Rs 5.34 lakh crore in 2019-20, growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 23 per cent.\n\nHowever, there is still a lot to be done in this area. According to estimates of ELCINA, the electronic components manufacturing sector suffers from a disability of around 10 per cent due to the lack of adequate infrastructure, domestic supply chain and logistics constraints, high cost of finance, inadequate availability of quality power, limited design capabilities and focus on R&D by the industry apart from inadequacies in skill development.\n\n\"We are looking at building a large electronics manufacturing ecosystem in India and it's certainly never late to start. Hence, FAB can be a steppingstone to make India the global electronics manufacturing hub of the world. It will also be in line for achieving the NPE 2019 target of $400 billions of domestic manufacturing and export of electronics,\" said\n\n, Chairman, ICEA.\n\nOut of this, \"a production of one billion mobile handsets is targeted by 2025, valued at $190 billion, including 600 million mobile handsets valued at $110 billion for export. Therefore, India has the opportunity and the capability to establish a full-fledged FAB electronics manufacturing ecosystem in the country,\"\n\nsaid in a statement.\n\nIn April 2020, the government announced a Rs 41,000-crore Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for manufacture of electronics in India. More recently, the scheme was extended to IT hardware with an outlay of Rs 7,350 crore.\n\nIn order to incentivise the electronics sector further, the government had come out with an Expression of Interest (EOI) for setting up of semiconductor wafer or device fabrication facilities in India or acquisition of semiconductor FABs outside India.\n\nIndia's display panel market is estimated to be of around $7 billion and is expected to grow to $15 billion in just four years, by 2025.\n\nHowever, setting up a display FAB manufacture unit is an extremely capital-intensive project and requires an estimated investment of around Rs 70,000-75,000 crore or roughly $10 billion over a period of 2-3 years.\n\n\"FAB manufacturing facility is a capital-intensive business, and it is present in very few geographies of the world. Hence, we should build a competitive environment. We need to be very aggressive in terms of providing proper infrastructure facilities such as water, power, and logistics apart from capital support,\" Mohindroo emphasised.\n\nA beginning has already been made in domestic\n\nas South Korean electronics giant\n\nhas already made an investment of Rs 4,825 crore for assembling displays in India.\n\nAccording to Aruna Sharma, a practicing development economist and former secretary, ministry of electronics and IT (MeitY), it is natural to move from just assembly to that of display FAB manufactured indigenously in the country.\n\n\"The intention to get into display FAB manufacture is seen by investments by Samsung and MeitYs' call on EoI. A plant can be set up in 2-3 years, thus giving advantage of not just reducing imports of parts considerably but also enable India to become a hub for exports of displays,\" Sharma noted.",

Only 2% of its 1.3 billion population have been fully immunized.\n\nThe government further opened up vaccination for adults from May 1 but registration on its\n\nwebsite is mandatory for those between the ages of 18 and 44. Slots are hard to get as demand far outstrips supply.\n\nIn a bid to streamline the process, computer experts have used the publicly available coding of the CoWIN platform to create websites that post results every few minutes after running automated searches on the government website.\n\nAlerts are sent over email and routed to several\n\napp chat groups where thousands are waiting.\n\nBerty Thomas, 35, automated a search to book himself a slot then created a website - under45.in - which checks for slots and sends alerts to about 100,000 people in 60 Telegram groups in various cities.\n\n\"I feel happy I'm able to use my skills to help people get vaccines,\" said Thomas, an investment banker based in the southern city of Chennai.\n\nShyam Sunder said his website - getjab.in - was notifying users by email when slots become available. Some 80,000 people from 400 districts across the country had registered with his site, he said.\n\nBut the technological workarounds are facing criticism from those who say they sacrifice the goal of vaccine equity in a country where many people - especially in rural areas - do not have the digital skills to join the online hunt.\n\n\"What we need: Free and equitable vaccination policy. What we have got: Techies making use of scripts to quickly book off the entirety of whatever little vaccine slots that open up,\" Twitter user Rakshith said.\n\nR.S. Sharma, chairman of the government panel managing the CoWIN platform, told Reuters security measures were in place and there was no unfair use of the booking platform, which he said was getting 55,000 hits a second.\n\n'STRESSFUL LOTTERY'\n\nTo book a slot, users of the CoWIN website need to log in with their mobile phone number and get a one-time password, before beginning their hunt of vaccine centres via an area code or district name.\n\nIn the short time that takes, slots often get snapped up.\n\nBut the automated alerts offer no guarantees. A Wednesday morning alert for some shots posted on one Telegram group for Bengaluru city had more than 100 comments, with only a few saying they succeeded, while others complained slots vanished in no time.\n\n\"It showed me 80 slots but it got booked before I could even get the\n\n,\" said one user.\n\nAuthorities in the city of Mumbai have faced criticism for issuing a notice on Twitter on Tuesday telling people to get ready as limited slots were opening in minutes, wishing the hopeful \"all the best\".\n\n\"Playing a stressful lottery every day is in extremely bad taste,\" Twitter user Nanaki wrote.\n\nIn their defence, Mumbai authorities wrote on Twitter they were trying their best and just wanted to keep the communication \"light\".\n\nThose in rural areas with limited or no access to high-speed internet or smartphones are bound to lose out.\n\nIn a village in the desert state of Rajasthan in the west, 43-year-old tailor Sewli Bhatti's said his family had no smartphone so he sought help from a teacher, who has been inundated with requests to register on the CoWIN website.\n\nDriver Dhananali Bariha, 28, in the eastern state of Odisha, said he wanted to get vaccinated but was stumped by the online registration.\n\n\"I have no idea how to do it.

In such times,\n\nhas sent an email to Google employees detailing how the company plans to bring employees back to offices.\n\nIn his email, Pichai wrote that Google is \u201ctesting new multi-purpose offices and private workspaces, and working with teams to develop advanced video technology that creates greater equity between employees in the office and those joining virtually.\u201d\n\nGoogle, as per Pichai, will move to a hybrid week culture. \u201cWe\u2019ll move to a hybrid work week where most Googlers spend approximately three days in the office and two days wherever they work best.\u201d\n\nThe company expects about 60% of Google employees to come to offices together, 20% to work from new office locations whereas the rest 20% will continue working from home.\n\n\u201cI am profoundly optimistic that once we do, we will be able to come back together in our offices to see all the people we have missed. And we\u2019ll be able to work together in entirely new ways that improve both our work and our lives,\u201d noted Pichai in his email.\n\nHere\u2019s the full email Pichai wrote to the employees:\n\nHi Googlers,\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve spent the last year focused on supporting employees during the pandemic. I hope the extra benefits such as Carer\u2019s Leave, the work-from-home allowance, the extra reset days, and the ability to work from wherever you need have been helpful in getting through this tough time.\n\n\n\nAnd we\u2019re not through it yet. It\u2019s heartbreaking to see COVID surging in places like India, Brazil, and many others around the world. If you live in one of these places, please focus on taking care of yourselves and your loved ones right now. We are here to support however we can.\n\n\n\nIn other areas, conditions are less dire and people are beginning to open up their lives and think about returning to the office. In fact, in places where we\u2019ve been able to reopen Google offices in a voluntary capacity, we\u2019ve seen nearly 60% of Googlers choosing to come back to the office.\n\n\n\nFor more than 20 years, our employees have been coming to the office to solve interesting problems \u2014 in a cafe, around a whiteboard, or during a pickup game of beach volleyball or cricket. Our campuses have been at the heart of our Google community and the majority of our employees still want to be on campus some of the time. Yet many of us would also enjoy the flexibility of working from home a couple days of week, spending time in another city for part of the year, or even moving there permanently. Google\u2019s future workplace will have room for all of these possibilities.\n\n\n\nOver the last year, a team within REWS has been reimagining a hybrid workplace to help us collaborate effectively across many work environments. They\u2019re testing new multi-purpose offices and private workspaces, and working with teams to develop advanced video technology that creates greater equity between employees in the office and those joining virtually. All of these efforts will help us work with greater flexibility and choice once we\u2019re able to return to our offices globally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat flexibility will come in a few different forms \u2014 and your product areas and functions will share more details on all of these changes by mid-June. Here are the key principles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA more flexible work week:\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ll move to a hybrid work week where most Googlers spend approximately three days in the office and two days wherever they work best. Since in-office time will be focused on collaboration, your product areas and functions will help decide which days teams will come together in the office. There will also be roles that may need to be on site more than three days a week due to the nature of the work.\n\nMore choice around where you work:\n\n\n\nMore locations globally: One of Google's biggest advantages is our global footprint. We are investing in many great communities globally \u2014 which creates more opportunity for employees to move around throughout their careers. By mid-June your PAs and functions will come back with a process by which you can apply to move to another office. In granting approvals, they\u2019ll take into account whether business goals can be met in the new location and whether your team has the right infrastructure in the site to support your work.\n\nRemote work: We\u2019ll also offer opportunities for you to apply for completely remote work (away from your team or office) based on your role and team needs. Before the pandemic, we had thousands of people working in locations separate from their core teams. I fully expect those numbers to increase in the coming months as we develop more remote roles, including fully all-remote sub teams. You\u2019ll be able to apply for remote work within your product area or function. As with location transfers, your leads will evaluate whether remote work can support the goals of the team and business. Whether you choose to transfer to a different office or opt for completely remote work, your compensation will be adjusted according to your new location.\n\nTaken together these changes will result in a workforce where around 60% of Googlers are coming together in the office a few days a week, another 20% are working in new office locations, and 20% are working from home.\n\nMore flexibility for your life:\n\n\n\nWork-from-anywhere weeks: Going forward, Googlers will be able to temporarily work from a location other than their main office for up to 4 weeks per year (with manager approval). The goal here is to give everyone more flexibility around summer and holiday travel.\n\nFocus time: Product areas and functions will also offer focus hours so we limit internal meetings during times when people need to be heads down on projects.\n\nReset days: We\u2019ll continue offering extra \u201creset\u201d days to help employees recharge during the pandemic in 2021. Our next global day off will be on Friday, May 28 (or the following work day if you\u2019re already not working on the 28th). Please enjoy it!\n\n\n\n\n\nI know this past year hasn\u2019t been easy for anyone and many Googlers are still suffering as the pandemic wears on. We will get through it \u2014 together \u2014 as a Google community.\n\n\n\nI am profoundly optimistic that once we do, we will be able to come back together in our offices to see all the people we have missed. And we\u2019ll be able to work together in entirely new ways that improve both our work and our lives.\n\n\n\nThe future of work is flexibility. The changes above are a starting point to help us do our very best work and have fun doing it.\n\n\n\nLook forward to continuing the conversation with all of you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSundar\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin\n\nTop Comment",

        "text": "Inc surprised Wall Street with significantly lower losses than expected and said it would deliver dependable profit on an adjusted basis beginning in the third quarter thanks to cost cuts that allow the company to earn more per ride.\n\nThe results come as Lyft emerges from more than a year of pandemic-related restrictions during which ridership and revenue plummeted. The company said it expected a strong rebound in U.S. travel in the third quarter, when many homebound Americans who hunger for travel are likely to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nShares were up 5.2% at $59 in after-hours trading on Tuesday. Over the previous five days they had lost 11%.\n\nLyft reported an adjusted $73 million first-quarter loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization - a metric that excludes more than $300 million in one-time costs, including stock-based compensation.\n\nThat is significantly narrower than the $144 million loss analysts had projected on average, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nLyft reaffirmed its goal to be profitable on the adjusted EBITDA metric in the third quarter of this year and said it would remain profitable beyond that time, even as the company invested in future growth opportunities.\n\nLyft President John\n\nsaid Lyft would take advantage of its leaner cost structure to make more money per rider as passengers return to the platform in greater numbers in the coming months.\n\nZimmer also played down the threat of federal regulation that would turn most ride-hail and food-delivery workers, who currently are independent contractors, into employees.\n\nLyft had recently pulled forward its profitability goal by three months when it announced the sale of its self-driving technology business for $550 million.\n\nLyft's larger rival,\n\n, has projected profitability on an adjusted basis by the end of 2021. Uber is scheduled to report results on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nOn a net basis, Lyft's loss widened to around $427 million, driven by high stock-based compensation costs as the result of the company's public listing more than two years ago.\n\nAt $609 million, first-quarter revenue also outstripped average Wall Street expectations for $559 million.\n\nLyft has drastically slashed costs during the pandemic when ridership plummeted and it continued to cut expenses in the first three months of 2021, even as riders gradually returned.\n\nTotal costs in the first quarter decreased by more than $344 million and overall, Lyft has slashed nearly $2.5 billion in costs since the beginning of last year.\n\nZimmer said the company also expected incentive spending for drivers to increase in the coming months, but executives during a conference call said those incentives were covered by the higher prices riders currently pay in many cities as demand temporarily outstrips supply.\n\nLyft Chief Executive Logan Green said he expected supply to balance out in the third quarter, once vaccinations increase, COVID-19 infections decrease and federal unemployment benefits for gig workers expire.\n\nThe number of active riders in the first quarter rose more than 7% from the last three months of 2020, but ridership still remains around 36% below last year.\n\nExecutives said they expect trip demand, particularly leisure and airport travel, to ramp up significantly in the third quarter.\n\nPRESSURE\n\nBut as business gradually returns, Lyft and its gig-economy peers in the ride-hail and food-delivery industry face regulatory pressure under the new administration of U.S. President Joe Biden, who campaigned on the promise of delivering benefits to gig workers by turning them into employees.\n\nThe shares of the companies took a tumble last week when U.S.\n\nSecretary Marty Walsh told Reuters in an interview that \"a lot of gig workers should be classified as employees.\"\n\nThe companies rely on low-cost flexible workers and say their services would become unavailable if workers were reclassified as employees. They say surveys show the majority of their workers do not want to be employees.\n\nZimmer on Tuesday played down the risks of federal regulation, saying a labor bill supported by U.S. Democrats faced tough odds of passing in\n\n.\n\nHe said the company instead was focused on adopting compromise regulation on the state and local levels, modeled after a November gig industry-sponsored California ballot measure that cemented ride-hail and food delivery workers' status as contractors, but provided them with some benefits.\n\n\"I honestly believe that we will continue to see common-ground, practical solutions that balance independence for drivers ... with additional benefits,\" Zimmer said, adding that he thinks the federal government will eventually pass guidance that makes it easier for states to adopt compromise regulation.",

In India,\n\n's biggest market with 400 million users, it got approval to start financial services in November.\n\nBy using debit or pre-paid cards numbers, WhatsApp's 120 million users in Brazil are able to send each other up to 5,000 reais per month through the messaging service free of charge. Initially, the system will not allow each transaction to surpass 1,000 reais or more than 20 transfers per day.\n\nThe roll out of the new feature will be phased, Chief Operating Officer Matthew Idema said in an interview. Starting today, a limited and undisclosed number of users will get a payment tool in their app. With that, they will be allowed to invite new users.\n\nIn June, WhatsApp had launched its payments services in Brazil, but the central bank suspended it some days later alleging it could damage the country's existing payments system in terms of competition, efficiency and data privacy.\n\nIn addition to reviewing the proposed payments network, the\n\nalso requested the technology giant be labeled as financial services company in Brazil, prompting Facebook to create a new unit called Facebook Pagamentos do Brasil, which is now regulated by the central bank.\n\nBut the central bank has not yet greenlit payments with merchants, which is expected to be a paid service, adding a new line of revenue for WhatsApp. Last year, card payments in Brazil totaled 2 trillion reais ($368.12 billion), up 8.2% from 2019.\n\nIdema said talks with the central bank are still ongoing and Facebook expects the launch of merchant payments to occur this year, declining to comment on whether it will be a paid service.\n\n\"For WhatsApp launching payments is interesting because it increases the app usage,\" the COO said.\n\nWhatsApp started its payment service in partnership with card networks\n\nand\n\nand payments processor Cielo SA.

ICICI Bank had told some payment gateway operators last Thursday to shut off its net banking services for merchants involved in buying or selling cryptocurrencies, either directly or indirectly.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nischal Shetty, the chief executive of cryptocurrency exchange\n\n, took to Twitter to express concern over banks refusing crypto transactions.\n\nThey were citing a 2018\n\nban on banks dealing in crypto, which the\n\nhad struck down in 2020, he said.\n\nA top executive of another crypto platform, who did not wish to be named, also said banks had told payment gateways to block such transactions despite the top court\u2019s directive.\n\n\u201cI request banks in\n\nto update their compliance teams about the Supreme Court ruling that set aside the RBI circular against crypto,\u201d Shetty wrote on Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair that the crypto industry has a clear go-ahead from the\n\nand yet banks deny banking to the industry.\u201d\n\nAccording to crypto executives who pleaded anonymity, ICICI Bank was among the last few big lenders providing services to\n\n.

So, that is what is being done,\u201d he explained.\n\nThough Unocoin does not use payment getaways that are dependent on ICICI Bank, the private sector lender informed a few weeks ago that it was suspending the company\u2019s account, said cofounder and CEO, Sathvik Vishwanath.\n\n\u201cWe didn't anticipate ICICI Bank would do this,\u201d Vishwanath said. \u201cWe are concerned about the culture it creates.

There has been an uptick in sales of FMCG products, medical devices such as oximeters and thermometers, as well as medicines, it said.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a similar spike in orders over the app, calls and walk-ins,\u201d said Gulshan Bhaktiani, co-founder, Wellness Forever Medicare, which closed the year ending March 31 with Rs 900 crore in revenue, a 25% jump year on year.\n\nAccording to industry trackers, the sector\u2019s growth is on top of an already robust revenue increase of around 35% last year.\n\nAn almost 3X expansion in the number of users ordering medicines online last year means the sector is bound to see strong growth this year as well.\n\n\u201cI think the growth will slow down because the base is much larger now.

According to security researcher, a fake SMS message is being circulated which promises to offer an app that will enable users to register for Covid-19 vaccine in India. But, instead of offering a legitimate way to register for the vaccine, this fake SMS installs malware on their mobile device.\n\nFrom Social\n\nThe Cybersecurity researcher from\n\ntweeted about this new\n\nwhich is asking users to download the app and register for Covid-19 vaccine. The researchers claim that the message is targeting Indian users and is designed to imitate 'covid-19 vaccine free registration'.\n\nThe researcher further explained that the SMS consists of a link that installs a worm app, which spears via SMS to victims' contacts and then downloads malware on their device. The app also gains unnecessary permissions which makes it easier for it to access user data.\n\nInitially, the app was called Covid-19 but later it was renamed to Vaccine Register. The researcher also revealed that the app also supports dual SIM connectivity. This enables the malware to control the device using the first available operator.\n\nSo, it is advised that users should refrain from downloading any app via SMS. It is also important that you should register only via legitimate sources which include\n\n,\n\nand Umang apps. However, there are some third-party websites using which you can receive a notification when a slot is available for vaccination. But, you will have to choose wisely.\n\nThe government is also offering an option to find your nearest Covid-19 vaccination centre by using the MyGov Corona Helpdesk via WhatsApp.",

According to a report by CNBC, the two companies haven\u2019t liked each other and it perhaps all began in 2011, a year after the iPad was launched.\n\nThe revelation was made through some documents that are part of the Apple vs Epic Games legal battle. The documents show some emails shared between\n\nand two other Apple executives.\n\nScott Forstall, who was then Apple\u2019s software head, sent an email to Jobs and another executive where he informed them about speaking to Facebook CEO\n\nabout the iPad app for Facebook. Forstall told Zuckerberg that Facebook shouldn\u2019t include embedded apps \u2014 like Farmville and others \u2014 in its Facebook iPad app. \u201cNot surprisingly, he wasn\u2019t happy with this as he considers these apps part of the \u2018whole Facebook experience\u2019 and isn\u2019t sure they should do an iPad app without them,\u201d Forstall wrote.\n\nZuckerberg wanted Apple to compromise and made a few suggestions as well. In a reply to Forstall\u2019s mail, Jobs said, \u201cI agree \u2014 if we eliminate Fecebooks third proposal it sounds reasonable.\u201d Yes, Jobs did refer to Facebook as \u201cFecebook\u201d in what doesn\u2019t seem like a \u2018typo\u2019.\n\nFacebook and Apple since then have had many issues between them. The most recent being the App Tracking Transparency feature which Apple introduced with iOS 14.5. Apple is giving more choice to users and let them allow which apps can track them. Facebook has been up in arms over this and called Apple the \u2018enemy\u2019 of small businesses.",

        "text": "A new study by Me2B Alliance, a non-profit organisation that is \u201ccommitted to giving individuals more say in how technology treats people\u201d, has claimed that Google\u2019s Android platform is eight times more likely to send data from school apps to \u201cvery high-risk\u201d third parties than iOS. For the study, the organisation collected a \u201crandom sample of 73 mobile applications used by 38 schools in 14 states across the US, covering at least a half a million people (students, their families, educators, etc.) who use those apps.\u201d\n\nThese third parties include ad platforms Google, Facebook and more, with Google receiving about 49% of the data traffic and Facebook getting about 14%. As for high-risk third parties, the study found that about 91% of Android apps shared student data with these parties, compared to 26% of iOS apps. The students\u2019 data is also reportedly being shared with \u201cvery high-risk third parties\u201d, with about 20% Android apps being the culprits, while only 2.6% of apps on iOS were found responsible for sharing which means that the Android apps were 8 times more likely to share with very high-risk third parties.\n\nAs per the report, the \u201cdata sent to third parties typically included unique identifiers (through Mobile Advertising Identifiers, or MAIDs), thus enabling profile building for students \u2013 including those under the age of 13 \u2013 by third-party advertising platforms.\u201d\n\nRead More:\n\nIt also claims that data of students is being shared with third parties as soon as they opened the app, even if they were not signed in. As per the report, more than 95% of the third-party data channels are active even when the user isn\u2019t signed in.\n\nThe report has called out both Google and Apple for not clearly specifying through their respective app stories as to which third parties the user data is being shared with.\n\nIt says, \u201cPeople still have too little information about which third parties they\u2019re sharing data with, and the app stores (Apple and Google Play) must make this information clearer.\u201d",

The split refers to the 30% fees that Apple charges developers for paid apps, purchases made inside the app along with subscriptions. While Schiller made it clear that he is a \u201cstaunch supporter\u201d of the fees, he was not confident that the 30% cut can remain \u201cunchanged forever\u201d, as per a report by Bloomberg which first was to report on the said email.\n\nEpic Games has dragged Apple to court claiming that Apple\u2019s rules are anticompetitive and unfair which has caused a loss of revenue. Apple has kicked out Fortnite from the App Store after Epic Games added its own payment system bypassing Apple. A separate payment mechanism meant that Epic Games need not pay commission to Apple at all, something that is totally against the policies of the\n\nmaker.\n\nIn his email, Schiller gave a head up by stating if at all Apple were to reconsider the commission and reduce it, the company should do it \u201cfrom a position of strength rather than weakness\u201d. He also said that once the App Store profit reached $1 billion annually then the fee could be reduced to 25% or even 20%. He mentioned that reducing the fee to 20% would be quite possible if the company was able to keep up with the $1 billion profit a year run rate as more people join Apple\u2019s ecosystem.\n\n\u201cI know that this is controversial, I just tee it up as another way to look at the size of the business, what we want to achieve, and how we stay competitive,\u201d he said Schiller in the email in July 2011.\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of the email as published by Bloomberg:",

        "title": "Asus ROG Phone 5 review: The gaming smartphone just got better",
        "text": "critic rating 4\n\nTop Features Soldi performance Good battery life Game-centric features\n\nAsus launched its first ROG branded smartphone back in 2018. The smartphone that practically introduced the gaming smartphone category to the world. Sure, it wasn\u2019t the first to inherit the gaming DNA from the parent company, but it was certainly more popular among the masses.\n\nThen, came the\n\n2 and ROG Phone 3. The latter brought significant yet practical improvement in terms of performance, features, design as well as game-centric features.\n\nAsus usually used to launch its ROG Phone in the second half of the year after the launch of Qualcomm\u2019s \u2018+\u2019 series processors. But, creating an exception, the company launched its\n\nin the first half.\n\nIt still comes with Qualcomm's latest and most powerful mobile chipset, it still carries the gaming DNA from all the previous generations and it still is a very capable gaming smartphone, at least on paper. Also, the launch price of Rs 49,999 appears to very promising for a smartphone with this kind of specifications.\n\nBut, what\u2019s new with the ROG Phone 5? Does it bring any significant improvement over the ROG Phone 3 or it is just a minor upgrade that can be easily skipped? Let\u2019s find out in our in-depth review.\n\nAsus ROG Phone 5: Design\n\nROG Phones makes its presence felt. That is the case with ROG Phone 5 as well. It carries the same bold and striking glass sandwich design as the previous ROG Phone. Even though Asus has been working hard to tone down its \u201cgamers\u201d design language for most of the ROG products including smartphones, the ROG Phone 5 still retains that but it feels more muted now.\n\nThe overall design of ROG Phone 5 is still far away from being called a boring design. The back panel now feels more premium with the new off-centered ROG logo, Republic of Gamers branding and that hexagonal camera module at the top that carries the triple camera setup.\n\nAlso, the new dot-matrix-styled ROG logo looks good and works as it used to on other ROG Phones. We just wished that Asus should have retained the regular LED RGB logo from ROG Phone 3 instead of this.\n\nAt the front, the smartphone carries a 6.78-inch display with FHD+ resolution along with dual front-firing speaker and front camera sensor. The ROG Phone 5 is built like a tank. It is heavy at 238 grams, but feels solid in hand.\n\nThe right side of the phone houses the volume rocker and power button which has a red accent to it. It is a tall phone and keeping that in mind, Asus has positioned the power button at almost centre for better reach even while holding the phone single-handedly. The right metal housing has engraved shoulder buttons also known as AirTriggers.\n\nThe left side of the phone gets a secondary USB port and a POGO connector for connecting accessories, etc. Then there\u2019s a Red coloured SIM card tray. At the bottom, the phone just has the primary microphone, headphone jack and primary USB Type-C port.\n\nAsus ROG Phone 5: Display\n\nThe ROG Phone 5 features a 6.78-inch FHD+ resolution Samsung-sourced AMOLED panel. Now, this is a 144Hz AMOLED panel, a first on any smartphone. Other features of the display include 300hz touch sampling rate, 24.3ms touch latency, 800nits of peak brightness, HDR10+ support and 111% DCI-P3 gamut coverage.\n\nIn our test, it is an absolutely gorgeous display to look at. Watching movies or playing games or doing anything else is comforting with those deep blacks and high contrast ratio. The colours are bright, vivid and punchy as well. The HDR10 support further adds to it.\n\nBut, the 800nits of peak brightness does feel a little less when using the smartphone outdoors. But, the higher frame rate easily makes up for it. It is one of the best displays we have seen on any smartphone.\n\nAsus\n\n: New chip and more\n\nThe ROG Phone 5 is powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 SoC paired with up to 12GB RAM and 256GB storage.\n\nOn paper, this is among the best configurations you can buy on any Android smartphone. So it checks the top-notch internals box. But, what it\u2019s like using it in the real world. Well, for starters, you won\u2019t find any major improvements in day-to-day usages. The opening and closing of apps and games is smooth. There\u2019s no lag or stutter no matter what.\n\nWe tested it by running multiple apps and games at the same time including COD Mobile, Chrome with around 20 tabs, Kine master video editing app, Lightroom and a couple of social media apps. The memory management is good here. Even after shuffling around with multiple apps, the KineMaster was still rendering the video in the background. Also, the Lightroom loaded up pretty fast without any lag or delay.\n\nThe Asus ROG Phone 5 brings improvements where it matters the most. It\u2019s no doubt among the most powerful Android smartphones, but the way it handles things is quite different from others.\n\nThe real potential we saw while doing creators tasks like shooting, editing a video or while editing a photo in Adobe Lightroom. A fast processor paired with vast storage and plenty of RAM can do miracles and this phone is almost there.\n\nAsus has almost managed to tame the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipset. Almost because the phone heats up a little and that eventually affects the performance of the smartphone. But, it is barely noticeable. Also, the new Aeroactive Cooler comes in handy in such situations and it does exactly what it is meant to do.\n\nThe smartphone does not become uncomfortable to hold at any moment. We tested this by playing COD Mobile at its best possible graphics settings for around 5 hours and heating here is not that bad.\n\nThe ROG Phone 5 is everything the ROG Phone 3 was but also comes with every piece of software tricks that Asus could put in a smartphone.\n\nFor example, the ROG Phone 3 has multi-zone AirTriggers, the ROG Phone 5 has that, but it is now more sensitive, offers better feedback and Asus has also added multiple motion triggers options as well.\n\nAnother good example is the customisation option using the updated Armory Crate, Game Genie, etc. Though basic functionality remains the same, it still allows users to customise the smartphones overall performance by offering a pre-configured option including a new X Mode+ which now works with Aeroactive Cooler only.\n\nIt also offers core-level system performance tweaking options for individual games. Users can customise each and everything from Network performance, display, CPU and GPU performance using the Armory Crate app. But, things do not end there. Asus has also opened up the core performance tuning options where it allows users to tweak some settings which 99% of smartphone makers do not even want to see.\n\nWe understand that Asus is trying to cater to a wide range of audience by offering both pre-configured performance modes for the muggle world who have no clue what\u2019s going on in the magical world. Simply put, the level of customisation the phone offers, a person who knows what he/she is doing can unleash the true potential of the ROG Phone 5 and Qualcomm Snapdragon 888.\n\nAlso, the ROG Phone 5 now comes with a headphone jack with DAC support. The company claims to offer better sound output. We tested that as well by using ROG Cetra II Core earphones. Which, by the way, sounds really good and offers deep and punchy bass output. The real deal with the Cetra II Core is the stereo separation it offers which makes the gaming experience much better.\n\nThen there are dual front-firing speakers backed by Dirac audio. They are even louder and bassier than the ROG Phone 5. We are glad that Asus has found a way to make things louder without losing much on quality.\n\nGaming performance\n\nWe have already talked much about what ROG Phone 5 is capable of. Gaming is among its core strengths and the advantage here is evident. We played around a dozen different titles on ROG Phone 5. Entry-level games with a less demanding nature ran at maximum FPS. Demanding titles like CoD Mobile, Shadow Fight 3, NOVA, Free Fire, Asphalt 9 and Shadowgun War Games -- Online PvP FPS.\n\nEvery game we opened greeted us with excellent loading speed, almost instantaneous. Post that most games defaulted to maximum graphics settings and delivered maximum support FPS by them. The graphics quality, details, shadows, etc are also very well represented. We never even felt any rendering delay while playing fast-paced games like Asphalt 9, CoD Mobile, etc. Also, all games worked with the AirTrigger and Motion gestures and let\u2019s admit, once you get habituated to shoulder buttons on a smartphone, there\u2019s no going back.\n\nBut, there\u2019s more to it. Asus ROG Phone 5 also supports several accessories including Aeroactive Cooler and Kunai Gamepad. We tested both, while the cooler works flawlessly as already mentioned, we are not very convinced by the Kunai Gamepad.\n\nFirst, it didn\u2019t work with some titles, second, the configuration process is very complicated and it took a good amount of time to set this up for the game where it worked. We tested it with both Bluetooth and USB mode and the results are the same. But again, once everything was set and got used to it. There\u2019s no going back. The level of comfort it offers while playing, the controller experience is really good.\n\nJumping to the software part, Asus usually likes to keep it clean with bare minimum apps with near to stock Android experience. Though themes are there and Asus also lets users choose whether they want to use the ROG theme or keep it stock Android while setting up the device.\n\nThe software experience is smooth and fluid. There are few apps like Armory Crate and Game Genie which come pre-installed, but they are necessary apps. The phone also comes with most of the features like dark mode, dual apps, app lock, etc.\n\nThe 6000mAh battery is good and it lasted for an entire day with plenty left for next under medium usages. If you wish to play long gaming sessions, then you might want to keep the device plugged in and use the power pass-through feature to keep it connected and charged without damaging the battery.\n\nThe phone also comes with couple of other tricks like scheduled charging, limit battery charging level and more.\n\nThe included 65W adapter charges the smartphone to full in just under 1.5 hours.\n\nAsus ROG Phone 5: Camera\n\nThe only department, where we think Asus left untouched is the camera. It features the same camera setup as ROG Phone 3, which is both a good and bad thing. The camera offers mixed experience. But before that let\u2019s take a look at the camera specs and features.\n\nThe ROG Phone 5 features a triple rear camera setup that consists of a 64MP primary sensor, a 13MP ultra-wide sensor and a 5MP macro sensor.\n\nThe primary 64MP sensor offers reasonable image quality with a good amount of detail in both daylight and low light conditions. We just wished to have a little more dynamic range and colour accuracy here. Sometimes the camera captured Orange colour as Purple which was so weird for us.\n\nThe ultrawide 13MP sensor and 5MP sensor also does a decent job here in both daylight and lowlight conditions.\n\nThe ROG Phone 5 can shoot up to 8K videos and we tried recording a few clips using the primary sensor at 8K resolution and the video quality has the same story to tell as the image quality.\n\nThe smartphone also comes with several shooting modes like Motion tracking, Pro, Macro, Pro Video, Night, Portrait, etc.\n\nAs far as the camera app is concerned, it is fast and fluid. The mode placement is within the reach and so are the shutter and gallery buttons.\n\nWell, the ROG Phone 5 features a decent set of rear camera that offers acceptable outputs in both photos and videos. But, we certainly feel that for a smartphone of this price, there should have been more.\n\nROG Phone 5: Verdict\n\nAt a starting price of Rs 49,999, the ROG Phone 5 is a pretty solid smartphone. It offers almost everything a gaming smartphone should offer without sacrificing much on other aspects like designs and features. At the same time, it misses out on something which also matters to people who are willing to pay this hefty price. For instance, the camera should have been better than the previous generation.\n\nKeeping everything aside for a moment, the ROG Phone 5 offers everything any user might want in their smartphone whether gamer or not gamer. Having said that, it is also true that ROG Phone 5 stands still with its gaming DNA.\n\nFor the asking price, it is unlike any other smartphone and it has a lot to offer which you won\u2019t find anywhere else. It has the right design, performance and display which is truly amazing. It is also among the most customisable smartphones in the market.\n\nWho should get this smartphone? Anyone who\u2019s looking for a smartphone that offers powerful performance, good display, decent camera and good battery life can definitely go for Asus ROG Phone 5 without thinking much about the bold design.\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin",

        "text": "German chipmaker\n\non Tuesday highlighted a lack of investment in new capacity by its manufacturing partners for tightness in semiconductor markets, saying it had invested to expand its own capacity to match market growth.\n\nA snapback in demand for everything from smartphones to cars, following a slump caused by the coronavirus pandemic, has disrupted chip supply chains especially in the car industry.\n\nInfineon said there have been bottlenecks in areas where it relies on contract manufacturers, known as foundries, such as\n\n, especially automotive microcontrollers and products used in the industrial internet.\n\n\"Foundries have not invested enough to keep up with the situation,\" Chief Executive Reinhard Ploss told analysts after Infineon raised its\n\nfor sales and\n\nfor its fiscal year to Sept. 30.\n\nDespite the upbeat outlook, Infineon shares declined by more than 4% in Frankfurt after a winter storm, which knocked out its own plant in Austin, Texas, exerted pressure on profit margins in the company's fiscal second quarter to March 31.\n\nThe Munich-based chipmaker expects supply constraints in its core automotive business - which accounts for 45% of revenues - to ease in the second half of this year, with lost volumes only likely to be made up in 2022.\n\nContract chip makers have invested chiefly in production of higher-margin processors used in devices like smartphones, leaving existing plants unable to meet demand for the older chips used in cars.\n\nScarcity was being felt above all in older 20- to 90-nanometre chips, where only now are foundries recognising that investing in new production is an economically viable proposition, said Chief Operating Officer Jochen Hanebeck.\n\n\"Foundries are investing now but the lead times to get this new capacity on board will be into 2023,\" he said.\n\nFORECASTS RAISED\n\nInfineon raised guidance for revenue in the current fiscal year to Sept. 30 to a midpoint of 11 billion euros ($13.2 billion) from 10.8 billion. It now expects a profit margin of 18%, up from an earlier view of 17.8%.\n\nSecond quarter revenue of 2.7 billion euros, up by 36% from the same period a year earlier, edged a consensus forecast of 2.69 billion euros in a poll of analysts published by the company.\n\nSegment result margin, management's preferred measure of operating profitability, came in at 17.4% in the quarter - ahead of a consensus view of 16.9% in a poll by Vara Research.\n\nThe weeks-long outage at its Austin plant - hit by a triple loss of power, gas and diesel due to the winter storm - knocked an estimated 1 percentage point off margins for the latest quarter.\n\nProduction in Austin is not expected to return to pre-storm levels until June, Ploss said, adding that it would not be possible to make up overall for lost production.",

Kevin Lee and Arvind Narayanan, researchers at Department of Computer Science and Center for Information Technology Policy, Princeton University, carried out a study in which they sampled 259\n\nnumbers available to new subscribers in the US. Here is what they have to say about it:\n\n\u201cWe sampled 259 phone numbers available to new subscribers at two major carriers, and found that 171 of them were tied to existing accounts at popular websites, potentially allowing those accounts to be hijacked. Additionally, a majority of available numbers led to hits on people search services, which provide personally identifiable information on previous owners. Furthermore, a significant fraction (100 of 259) of the numbers were linked to leaked login credentials on the web, which could enable account hijackings that defeat SMS-based multi-factor authentication.\u201d\n\nYour old phone number, if it gets into the wrong hands, could serve that person with your information, which could then be misused. Also, the study found that the new owners of an old number continued to get personalised updates meant for the former owner, with details like \u201cblood test results\u201d, \u201cspa appointment reservations\u201d, etc.\n\nThe researchers add that when changing to a new phone number, customers usually forget to immediately update all of their online accounts. Since the old numbers were tied to two-factor authentication, this opens a window for someone to log into your social media accounts, access your email and control other personal online accounts. The researchers said that your personal information could be easily collected from online \u201cpeople search sites\u201d like BeenVerified or Intelius, and used to augment the account takeovers. So, it\u2019s recommended to update or shut down all your online accounts tied to the phone number you are about to change for a new one.",

He noted that Musk, Maron, Chang and compensation committee chair Ira Ehrenpreis have yet to be deposed in the case.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued in their motion to compel that Tesla was improperly shielding hundreds of documents that Maron or Chang shared with the compensation committee and its advisers.\n\nAttorney Gregory Varallo told Slights on Monday that the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which was filed in 2018, still don't have an answer to a simple question: \"Whose idea was the largest compensation plan ever designed?\"\n\n\"If you read the record to date, no one seems to know,\" said Varallo. \"There was quite a lot of sausage-making taking place before this was even a twinkle in the eye of the compensation committee,\" he added.\n\nVanessa Lavely, an attorney representing the Tesla directors, told Slights that the board followed \"a robust process\" to develop and approve the compensation plan.\n\n\"There was absolutely no rubber-stamping here, and the defendants look forward to the opportunity to present this record to the court,\" she said.\n\nIn 2019, Slights refused to dismiss the breach-of-duty claims against Musk and Tesla directors, and an unjust enrichment claim against Musk.\n\nUnder Delaware's \"business judgment\" rule, courts typically give strong deference to a corporate board's decision-making unless there is evidence that directors had conflicts or acted in bad faith. If a plaintiff is able to overcome the business judgment rule's presumption, the board's action is then subject to an \"entire fairness\" analysis, which shifts the burden to the corporation to show that the deal involved both fair dealing and fair price.\n\nSlights said that because the plaintiffs had adequately pleaded that Musk was a controlling shareholder and had a conflict of interest, the case lent itself to \"heightened judicial suspicion.\"\n\nUnder the plan, Musk stands to reap billions if the electric car and solar panel maker hits ambitious market capitalization and operational milestones. For each of 12 milestones the company achieves, Musk, who already owned more than 20% of Tesla when the plan was approved, would get stock equal to 1% of outstanding shares at the time of the grant.\n\nEach milestone includes growing Tesla's market capitalization by $50 billion and meeting aggressive revenue and pretax profit growth targets. Musk would receive the full benefit of the pay plan, $55.8 billion, only if he leads Tesla to a market capitalization of $650 billion and unprecedented revenues and earnings within a decade.",

Internally TSMC is planning to build up to six fabs,\" the person said, adding that it was not possible to give a timeframe.\n\nThe Biden administration is preparing to spend tens of billions of dollars to support domestic chip manufacturing. Under existing legislation, foreign firms are eligible for those funds, but whether they will ultimately receive it is an open question.\n\nA second person familiar with the plans said the company had already made sure there was enough space for expansion when they obtained the land for the first plant.\n\n\"It's so they can build six fabs,\" the source said.\n\nThe third person, from a TSMC supplier involved in the Arizona project, said TSMC had told them the plan was to build a total of six fabs over the next three years.\n\nReuters was not able to independently confirm the timeframe.\n\nTSMC referred to comments by CEO C.C. Wei on an earnings call last month, saying the company was starting chip production in Arizona in 2024 with a 20,000 wafer per month 5-nanometer technology.\n\n\"But in fact, we have acquired a large piece of land in Arizona to provide flexibility. So further expansion is possible, but we will ramp up to Phase 1 first, then based on the operation efficiency and cost economics and also the customers' demand, to decide what the next steps we are going to do.\"\n\nAsked whether the planned expansion was because of a request from the United States, TSMC said, \"Once there is any official decision, we will disclose it accordingly.\"",

        "title": "Apple Epic Games case: Epic Games CEO cites Apple's 'total control' over iPhones at first day of antitrust trial",
        "text": "OAKLAND: The chief executive of \"Fortnite\" creator Epic Games testified on Monday that he knew he was breaking\n\nInc's\n\nrules by putting Epic's own in-app payment system into the game last year but wanted to highlight Apple's sway over the world's\n\nusers, which now total 1 billion.\n\n\"I wanted the world to see that Apple exercises total control over all software on iOS, and it can use that control to deny users' access to apps,\" Tim Sweeney said from behind layers of plexiglass in a federal courthouse in Oakland, California, on the first day of an\n\nagainst Apple.\n\nThe trial, expected to run three weeks, brings to a head a lawsuit Epic brought last year in the\n\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California that centers on two\n\nle practices that have become cornerstones of its business: Apple's requirement that virtually all third-party software for the world's 1 billion iPhones be distributed through its App Store, and the requirement that developers use Apple's in-app purchase system, which charges commissions of up to 30%.\n\nEpic broke Apple's rules in August when it introduced its own in-app payment system in \"Fortnite\" to circumvent Apple's commissions. In response, Apple kicked Epic off its App Store.\n\nEpic sued Apple, alleging the iPhone maker is abusing its power over app developers with App Store review rules and payment requirements that hurt competition in the software market. Epic also launched an aggressive public relations campaign to call attention to its allegations just as Apple's practices have come under scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators in the United States and elsewhere.\n\nIn opening arguments, Epic attorney Katherine Forrest of Cravath, Swaine & Moore laid out the gaming company's argument that Apple has \"brick by brick\" built its App Store into a \"walled garden\" meant to extract fees from developers who want to access Apple's 1 billion iPhone users. Forrest argued that Apple has locked those users into its ecosystem with apps like iMessage, which lets Apple users send messages to other devices but has limited functionality when communicating with Android users.\n\n\"The most prevalent flower in the walled garden is the Venus fly trap,\" Forrest argued before Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers.\n\nApple has countered Epic's allegations by arguing its App Store rules have made consumers feel safe and secure in opening up their wallets to unknown developers, helping create a massive market from which all developers have benefited. Apple argues that Epic intentionally broke its contracts with Apple because the game maker wanted a free ride on the iPhone maker's platform.\n\nIn opening arguments for Apple, attorney Karen Dunn of Paul, Weiss noted Epic is asking the judge to force Apple to let third-party software be installed on its phones outside the App Store, similar to the \"side loading\" the Android operating system already allows.\n\n\"Epic is asking for government intervention to take away a choice that consumers currently have,\" Dunn told the court.\n\nThe courtroom was closed to the public, but in the audience as a \"corporate witness\" for each side were Epic's Sweeney and Phil Schiller, Apple's App Store chief.\n\nDuring his testimony, Sweeney said Epic does pay commissions to other platform owners such as Sony Group Corp's PlayStation and\n\n's Xbox but explained that those hardware makers use fees from developers to subsidize the further development of their hardware.\n\nJudge Gonzalez Rogers also asked her first direct questions of the trial during Sweeney's testimony, inquiring whether Apple's original iPhones from 2007 and 2008 were sophisticated enough to run Epic's video games. Sweeney said they were not.\n\n\"So Apple did have to do something to the iPhone itself in order for it to be sophisticated enough to play your software? How is that any different than consoles?\" she asked.\n\nSweeney responded that the hardware development was similar, but the two devices had different business models.\n\nSweeney and Schiller are expected to attend the entire trial, which will also feature in-person testimony from Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook and other senior executives at both firms.\n\nEpic is not seeking monetary damages but is asking the court to hand down orders that would end many of Apple's practices.",

        "title": "Uber, Lyft have a California playbook to fight proposed US rules on workers",
        "text": ",\n\nand other gig-economy companies face a new challenge from the Biden administration to their use of contract workers, but as they gear up for a fight in Washington they could turn to a lobbying playbook that helped them score a decisive win against California regulators last year.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden campaigned on the promise of providing legal protections and benefits to gig workers, who as independent contractors generally have no access to unemployment insurance, sick pay and health insurance. U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh said last week: \"A lot of gig workers should be classified as employees.\"\n\nIn\n\n, Democratic lawmakers are pushing a union-supported labor bill, the PRO Act, that in part is modeled after a California law called AB5 that reclassified most gig workers as employees.\n\nAB5, however, is no longer the law in California for ride-hail and food delivery workers, while it remains in effect for other freelancers.\n\n, Lyft Inc, DoorDash Inc and Instacart, whose business model relies on low-cost flexible labor, mounted a $205 million campaign that overturned the law for the industry last November.\n\nAmong the tactics honed in the California fight, the gig-work companies used their apps to reach out to voters and drivers through messages, emails, mailed leaflets, billboards, radio and online ads. They also urged workers on their platforms to speak out against AB5.\n\nThe companies threatened an end to ubiquitous food-delivery and ride-hail services many consumers have gotten used to during the pandemic if drivers were classified employees.\n\nThe looming fight over the status of gig-economy workers comes amid a wider debate over business regulation. The federal government exercised a light hand in regulating Uber, DoorDash and other digital-economy companies as they redefined traditional definitions of work, communications or retailing. Now, Democrats and Republicans in Washington, for different reasons, are calling for the government to exercise more control over one-time startups that dominate significant sectors of the economy.\n\nUber, Lyft, DoorDash and Instacart so far this year have spent a combined $1.3 million to lobby the Biden administration and members of the U.S. House and\n\n, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. In 2020 they spent some $5.7 million, more than half of which came from Uber.\n\nLOBBYING PUSH\n\nLess than two weeks after Biden won the\n\nin November, companies banded together to form the App-Based Work Alliance, a Washington-based advocacy group. The group is now promoting statements of drivers and food-delivery workers saying they want to remain independent contractors, and do not want the PRO Act because they fear it would deprive them of opportunities to earn money on their own schedule for a few hours a week.\n\nThe companies cite surveys to argue the majority of their mostly part-time workers do not want to be classified as employees.\n\nWhile the surveys show massive support for remaining independent contractors, they also follow years of threats by the companies of eliminating work opportunities if workers become employees. Some of the surveys are co-written by researchers with company ties, sponsored by the companies or completed with unscientific methodologies by a blogger who sent out emails and social media posts.\n\nFor example, one study by the National Bureau of Economic Research listed Uber's chief economist, Jonathan Hall, as a co-author, and a 2020 survey of 1,000 drivers by Benenson Strategy Group and GS Strategy Group was paid for by Uber. Uber said that while it paid for the poll, the survey was conducted by reputable research groups.\n\nIn California, the gig companies did not simply oppose any changes to their employment practices. Instead, they campaigned for compromise, advocating changes to labor laws to allow workers to remain contractors while also receiving more modest benefits than required for employees.\n\nDoorDash said its workers on average work just four hours a week, while Uber said 37% of its U.S. drivers and 58% of its delivery people averaged fewer than 10 hours per week in the last quarter of 2020. The companies say those part-time gigs would become impossible under an employment model.\n\nBut Uber data from the fourth quarter of 2019, before the pandemic, also showed that California drivers working 25 hours and more per week completed more than 60% of all trips in the state, suggesting that full-time drivers complete the bulk of the work.\n\nDRIVER ADVOCACY\n\nGig Workers Rising, a group of workers that advocates for greater benefits and says it does not receive financial support from labor groups, in a statement dismissed the companies' compromise proposal.\n\n\"(The proposal) is not a blueprint for workers' rights, it's a game plan for gig corporations and investors looking to maximize their profits,\" the group said in a statement.\n\nThe defeat of AB5 for app-based gig workers in California was a blow to organized labor groups, California's Democrats and even Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who had urged the state's voters to reject the gig industry's proposal.\n\nThough AB5 is gone, gig workers in California now have access to some benefits, including healthcare subsidies, accident insurance and minimum pay while passengers are in their car. Those benefits are significantly less costly to the companies than employee benefits and labor groups say drivers do not know how to access them.\n\nAs the fight over gig-worker rights heats up on the national level, the companies could deploy similar measures.\n\n\"Right now there's no call for action, but if that became the case, for example if a real piece of legislation or ballot measure was put forward, we'd certainly activate our driver base,\" a Lyft spokeswoman said.\n\nUber and DoorDash said they had no specific plans for an outreach campaign as of now. Uber in August sent an email to all its drivers nationwide, outlining its proposal for a change in law to combine independent contractor status with some benefits.",

Esta stands for Electronic System for Travel Authorisation, which the US began charging the UK travellers for in 2010.

It says that it \u201cfound adverts for expensive third-party sellers every time it searched during a 12-month period.\u201d\n\nThe report adds: \u201cIn the UK, changing the address on your driving licence is free - but Google consistently showed adverts for services charging \u00a349.99. Applying for an Esta travel permit to visit the US should cost no more $14 (\u00a310) - but Google repeatedly allowed adverts for websites charging more than $80. In Google's search results, adverts look similar to organic results and appear at the top of the list.\u201d\n\nIn a statement given to the BBC, Google said: \"We have strict policies that govern the types of ads and advertisers we allow on our platforms. We only allow governments or their delegated providers to advertise for official documents or services.\"\n\nThe tech giant also claimed that it had removed 3.1 billion advertisements that violated its policies in 2020.",

It goes: \u201cIf you know beforehand that a meeting should be recorded then it would be nice to have an option when scheduling the meeting to start recording automatically.

Solid Power declined to say at what level the funding round values the company.\n\n\"The partnerships and the capital that comes along with it are really going to put us on a good footing to execute on our road map, which simply speaking is qualifying this technology for vehicle use and getting them into vehicles in the not-too-distant future,\" Solid Power Chief Executive and co-founder Doug Campbell said in an interview.\n\nCarmakers are racing to develop EVs amid tightening CO2 emission standards in Europe and China.\n\nSolid-state battery technology involves a high-capacity energy storage device that improves on lithium-ion batteries, replacing the liquid or gel-form electrolyte with a solid, conductive material. Among other benefits, the new technology offers more energy density and better safety due to a lack of flammable components. Solid Power has said its technology can deliver 50% more energy density than current lithium-ion batteries.\n\nHowever, solid-state battery technology is more expensive than lithium-ion cell technology. It also must prove it can operate and remain durable in the real world, and must increase its scale to meet industry demand.\n\nMonday's announcement marks the second investment in Solid Power for Ford and Volta Energy. Both participated in the $26 million Series A round in 2018 that included Hyundai Motor Co and\n\n.\n\n\"We've been working with more than a dozen different startups in this space and we've been most impressed with the progress that Solid Power has made,\" Hau Thai-Tang, Ford's chief product platform and operations officer, said.\n\nSolid Power, based near Denver, raised $5 million in convertible debt from BMW iVentures earlier this year. Its partnership with the German automaker began in 2016.\n\nFollowing the latest investments, Ford and BMW will own equal, unidentified stakes in Solid Power, which was established in 2012 as a spinout from the University of Colorado Boulder, Campbell said.\n\nFord is pushing to electrify key models in its lineup, including the Transit van late this year and F-150 pickup mid-2022, and already sells the all-electric Mustang Mach-E SUV. It previously said it will invest $22 billion in electrification through 2025.\n\nBy the end of 2021, BMW aims to have five fully electric models available across the BMW and MINI brands, and it said by 2023 it will have fully electric models available for almost all of its market segments.\n\nToyota Motor Corp, which has called the technology a \"game changer,\" plans to introduce solid-state batteries on an electrified platform by 2025.\n\nAnother solid-state battery startup is\n\n-backed QuantumScape, which aims to introduce its battery in 2024. It went public last year through a reverse merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC).\n\nCampbell declined to say whether Solid Power is exploring going public with a SPAC.",

        "text": "Over 60 US stadiums and other venues are deploying an app from\n\nto verify people's COVID-19 status, placing the New York company known for its airport security fast lanes at the forefront of a national debate over \"vaccine passports.\"\n\n's San Francisco Giants and New York Mets are among the first big businesses to demand guests prove they tested negative for the virus or are immunized against it. While the teams welcome paper proof, they encourage downloading records onto Clear's Health Pass feature for convenience.\n\nAs with mask mandates, such requirements are under attack from Republican politicians and anti-surveillance activists, as un-American intrusions on civil liberties. They fear businesses will discriminate against the unvaccinated and unnecessarily amass personal data.\n\nRepublican governors including in Florida and Texas last month moved to bar some establishments from asking about immunization status, though legal experts say door-checks are lawful to protect public health.\n\nPrivacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation fears Clear and other passport apps will hold data indefinitely and morph into consumer trackers. Clear said users control their health records.\n\nAs a business based on replacing physical IDs, tickets and credit cards with facial or fingerprint recognition, Clear has a huge opportunity in emerging health-check rules that would familiarize more people with its technology.\n\n\"Those experiences where you have to prove something about you - if we can help empower the consumer to get through that more quickly - that is our core business,\" said Catesby Perrin, Clear's executive vice president of growth.\n\nSo far, Clear is among coronavirus health app frontrunners, with partners including\n\nfor its Los Angeles-to-Honolulu flights and the Venetian resort in Las Vegas for conventions it hosts.\n\nWith fans anxious to get back to live sports, the Giants said its promotion generated about 6,000 Clear downloads in April. Nationwide, over 70,000 Health Passes are used for venue admission weekly, Clear said, though the app is only starting to verify vaccination status.\n\n(Graphic: U.S. installations of Clear's app soar as venues reopen: https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/VACCINE-APP/azgpoxorbvd/chart.png)\n\nAlso gaining traction is Excelsior Pass, funded by New York state, which supports verification of tests and vaccinations within the state. The app generated 500,000 certificates in April, and a companion app for businesses to verify them had 40,000 installations, New York spokeswoman Jennifer Givner said.\n\nExcelsior Pass developer IBM Corp is in discussions with additional states, vice president Eric Piscini said.\n\nIn Europe, several governments have introduced apps that may be required to access transport, gyms and restaurants, while the 27-nation\n\nraces to develop a \"gateway\" that will enable them to work across borders.\n\nAirline-backed Travel Pass and the nonprofit CommonPass, which was installed an estimated 20,000 times over the last two months in the United States, are being tested for international flight checks.\n\nIt remains unclear whether high-tech options to prove health status will be widely required. At their best, apps would combat fake records by validating information against public health databases, but that is no small task.\n\nPiscini said it requires accessing at least 64 separate databases in the United States. But California, for example, has yet to specify whether and when it will share records with apps.\n\nClear has started testing access to vaccination records but declined to disclose details.\n\nNew online tools that have gained a few thousand users, including VaxYes and ConfirmD, are attesting to the veracity of vaccine certificate uploads by having medical professionals weed out forgeries.\n\n\"The demand (to automate) is there. There's just a myriad different hoops to get through,\" said Mohammad Gaber, chief executive of VaxYes developer GoGet.\n\nAIRPORTS TO BALLPARKS\n\nClear users upload a driver's license or other identity document and take a selfie, which the system checks to make sure they match before connecting to COVID-19 test results from hundreds of labs or the proof of vaccination.\n\nSome venues also require a symptom survey on Clear or an automated temperature check at a Clear kiosk.\n\nUsers get a \"green\" pass with their headshot and a QR code to show staff or scan at entrances. Venues pay for the system.\n\nTexas music festival Electric Cookout adopted Health Pass to reduce chances of an outbreak, said co-founder Pooja Shah. About 50 out of 1,200 attendees used it at an April event and received access to special areas, she said.\n\nClear's primary service, priced at $179 annually, enables customers to use biometric scans to skip ID card inspections at nearly 40 U.S. airports. It also offers a free service enabling registered users to jet through \"Clear lanes\" to access entertainment venues.\n\nCombining subscribers and non-paying users, Clear, whose services also go by Alclear and Secure Identity, said it has about 5.7 million members.\n\nThe company will not disclose financial results, but announced in February a $100 million funding round with investors including growth firm General Atlantic and the\n\n's 32 Equity fund.\n\nClear still has hurdles to become accepted and get people comfortable with using it.\n\nThe Seattle Mariners baseball team promoted Clear's technology for ID-less beer purchases from 2018 through 2019. The team said the effort did not generate \"meaningful\" usage data.\n\nWashington state's alcohol regulator said Clear cannot be the \"sole methodology for ascertaining legal age.\"\n\nClear said it was pleased with results and continues to educate regulators.\n\nThe Giants aim to enable card-less concession sales this year, and its chief business development officer, Jason Pearl, is enthusiastic about Clear's technology. \"I don't think anyone else comes close.\"",

Researchers have now found new variants of the\n\nflaw that affects almost all new processors from Intel and AMD with \u201cmicro-op caches\u201d.\n\n\u201cModern Intel, AMD, and ARM processors translate complex instructions into simpler internal micro-ops that are then cached in a dedicated on-chip structure called the microop cache,\u201d explained researchers from University of Virginia and University of California San Diego.\n\nThe researchers claimed that the flaws are crucial because the current patches are not enough to protect users. Having said that the newly found vulnerabilities are hard to crack.\n\nThe researchers said that there could be three types of attacks. \u201c(1) a same thread cross-domain attack that leaks secrets across the userkernel boundary, (2) a cross-SMT thread attack that transmits secrets across two SMT threads via the micro-op cache, and (3) transient execution attacks that have the ability to leak an unauthorized secret accessed along a misspeculated path, even before the transient instruction is dispatched to execution, breaking several existing invisible speculation and fencing-based solutions that mitigate Spectre,\u201d as per the report that they have published.\n\nBoth Intel and AMD have been warned about the vulnerabilities which would allow hackers to steal data from systems. While there is no information as to when we can expect both the companies to fix the issues the thing is that using micro-ops cache vulnerabilities to steal data is a tough job that requires a particular malware to breach all levels of hardware and software security restrictions.\n\nAlso, another challenge is that the solutions suggested by the researchers to eliminate the risk could be quite difficult for Intel and AMD to administer as there is a \"much greater performance penalty\" involved.",

This second wave of the pandemic in India has been particularly challenging, and we want to ensure all our support to fight this pandemic and come out stronger,\" Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat said.\n\nAt this critical time, the company is committed to accelerate medical assistance in India through the Capgemini Social Response Unit, Ezzat added.\n\n\"This fund will help to enhance the efforts of the\n\nand State authorities in building long-term medical infrastructure in India,\" Ezzat said.\n\nAshwin Yardi, CEO of Capgemini in India, said the company is also striving to extend help to the communities by providing access to critical care, which is required immediately for the fight against COVID-19 as well as medical needs in the coming years.\n\nDuring 2020, in line with Capgemini's social commitment, Capgemini's Social Response Unit (SRU) provided 65 fully equipped ICU beds to three BMC hospitals in Mumbai, as well as 100 Oxygen Concentrators (OC) and 65 High Flow Nasal Cannulas (HFNC) to 15 government hospitals across Bengaluru.\n\nThese ICU beds, which are fully equipped with ventilators, ECG monitors, and other critical ICU patient-monitoring devices, are currently being used to treat patients critically affected by COVID-19.\n\nThe massive rise in infections in the second wave of the pandemic has led to hospitals in several states reeling under a shortage of medical oxygen and beds. Social media timelines are filled with SOS calls with people looking for oxygen cylinders, hospital beds, plasma donors, and ventilators.\n\nOrganisations across the spectrum have come forward to source and donate oxygenators, breathing machines, and ventilators.\n\nIT companies like Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and HCL Technologies are taking a number of steps to contribute to these efforts including setting up COVID care centres at their facilities.",

        "text": "An Indian-origin researcher has warned that billions of computers and other\n\nacross the globe are vulnerable today owing to a vulnerability named 'Spectre' that was first discovered in 2018 but is open to hackers again.\n\nSince 'Spectre' was discovered, the world's most talented computer scientists from industry and academia have worked on software patches and hardware defenses, confident they've been able to protect the most vulnerable points in the speculative execution process without slowing down computing speeds too much.\n\nHowever, researchers, led by Ashish Venkat at the University of Virginia's School of Engineering and Applied Science, UVA Engineering, discovered that computer processors are open to hackers again.\n\nThey found a whole new way for hackers to exploit something called a \"micro-op cache,\" which speeds up computing by storing simple commands and allowing the processor to fetch them quickly and early in the speculative execution process.\n\nMicro-op caches have been built into\n\nmanufactured since 2011.\n\nVenkat's team discovered that hackers could steal data when a processor fetches commands from the micro-op cache.\n\n\"Think about a hypothetical airport security scenario where TSA lets you in without checking your boarding pass because (1) it is fast and efficient, and (2) you will be checked for your boarding pass at the gate anyway,\" Venkat said.\n\nA computer processor does something similar. It predicts that the check will pass and could let instructions into the pipeline.\n\n\"Ultimately, if the prediction is incorrect, it will throw those instructions out of the pipeline, but this might be too late because those instructions could leave side-effects while waiting in the pipeline that an attacker could later exploit to infer secrets such as a password,\" he elaborated.\n\nBecause all current 'Spectre' defenses protect the processor in a later stage of speculative execution, they are useless in the face of Venkat's team's new attacks.\n\nTwo variants of the attacks the team discovered can steal speculatively accessed information from\n\nand\n\nprocessors.\n\n\"Intel's suggested defense against Spectre, which is called LFENCE, places sensitive code in a waiting area until the security checks are executed, and only then is the sensitive code allowed to execute,\" Venkat informed.\n\n\"But it turns out the walls of this waiting area have ears, which our attack exploits. We show how an attacker can smuggle secrets through the micro-op cache by using it as a covert channel.\"\n\nThis newly discovered vulnerability will be much harder to fix.\n\nIn the case of the previous 'Spectre' attacks, developers have come up with a relatively easy way to prevent any sort of attack without a major performance penalty for computing.\n\n\"The difference with this attack is you take a much greater performance penalty than those previous attacks,\" said PhD student Logan Moody.\n\nVenkat's team has disclosed the vulnerability to the product security teams at Intel and AMD.\n\nThe team's paper has been accepted by the highly competitive International Symposium on Computer Architecture, or\n\n.",

Outside China, Tesla's outspoken chief executive Elon Musk regularly takes to Twitter to comment on or criticise regulators or rules.\n\nBut in past weeks, Tesla executives attended at least four policy discussions, on topics including auto data storage, vehicle-to-infrastructure communication technologies, car recycling and carbon emissions, the people said.\n\nCalifornia-based Tesla, which makes electric Model 3 sedans and Model Y sport-utility vehicles at its own plant in Shanghai, did not make major commitments at the meetings, but participated in some discussions, they said.\n\n\n\nRECRUITMENT ADS\n\nTesla is also expanding its government relationship team in China, one of the sources said.\n\nAccording to two recruitment advertisements in April on its WeChat account, Tesla is hiring managers to update a policy database and maintain relationships with government and industry associations to \"build a harmonious external environment to support Tesla's business development in the regional market.\"\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many managers Tesla was planning to hire for government relations.\n\nAccounting for roughly 30% of Tesla's global sales, China is the automaker's second biggest market after the United States and helped it post record first-quarter vehicle deliveries.\n\nPressure has been building over the past few months on Tesla's mostly excellent relations with Beijing.\n\nIn February, Chinese regulators summoned it over consumer reports of battery fires, unexpected acceleration and failures in over-the-air software updates.\n\nAnd in March, Tesla came under scrutiny when the military banned its cars from entering its complexes, citing security concerns over vehicle cameras, sources told Reuters at the time. Days later, Musk appeared by video at a high-level forum, saying that if Tesla used cars to spy in China or anywhere, it would be shut down.\n\nLast month, Tesla was targeted by state media and regulators after a customer, angry over the handling of her complaint about malfunctioning brakes, climbed on top of a Tesla car in protest at the Shanghai auto show. Videos of the incident went viral.\n\nGrace Tao, a Tesla vice president who heads its government relations effort in China, was criticised in state media last month after she was quoted in a media interview questioning whether the aggrieved customer was acting on her own.\n\nIn response to the different complaints, Tesla has said it would set up a China data center, launch self-inspection to improve services and work with regulators.",

        "text": "faces an uphill legal battle against\n\nInc in an antitrust trial starting Monday, and a defeat for the maker of \"Fortnite\" could make it harder for U.S. government regulators to pursue a similar case against the\n\nmaker, legal experts said.\n\nBut win or lose at the trial, Epic, which has pursued an aggressive public relations campaign against Apple alongside its court pleadings, may have already accomplished a major goal: Drawing Apple squarely into the global debate over whether and how massive technology companies should be regulated.\n\nApple has mostly succeeded in staying out of the regulatory crosshairs by arguing that the iPhone is a niche product in a smartphone world dominated by Google's Android operating system. But that argument has become harder to sustain with the number of iPhone users now exceeding 1 billion.\n\nEpic alleges Apple has such a strong lock on those customers that the\n\nconstitutes a distinct market for software developers over which Apple has monopoly power. Apple is abusing that power, Epic argues, by forcing developers to use Apple's in-app payment systems - which charge commissions of up to 30% - and to submit to app-review guidelines the gaming company says discriminate against products that compete with Apple's own.\n\n\"It's not a super-strong suit - I don't think they are likely to win,\" said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a law professor at Vanderbilt Law School. \"But it has already achieved a lot of its purpose, which is drawing attention to some of Apple's practices that many developers see as abusive.\"\n\nUPHILL BATTLE\n\nEpic's arguments draw on major antitrust cases against\n\n, Eastman Kodak and American Express, but apply those precedents in new ways that have not been tested in U.S. courts, legal experts said.\n\nFor example, in arguing that iPhones are a software market unto themselves, Epic relies partly on a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court decision that rejected efforts by Kodak to force owners of its copying machines to use Kodak repair services.\n\nSpencer Waller, a competition law professor at the Loyola University Chicago School of Law, said the Kodak decision has had mixed success in subsequent cases.\n\n\"Plaintiffs are often unsuccessful because courts read Kodak narrowly at times,\" Waller said.\n\nEpic also faces hurdles in its contention that Apple's in-app payment commissions are too high at 30% and could be as much as 10 times lower if market forces prevailed. American courts have been reluctant to dive into setting specific rates, in large part because unlike Europe, the prevailing interpretation of U.S. antitrust law does not consider a dominant firm charging high prices to be anticompetitive in itself.\n\nApple argues that whatever dominant position it may have in mobile software is an outgrowth of its creation of both the iPhone and a curated App Store that makes consumer comfortable.\n\n\"If you obtained a monopoly legitimately, you're allowed to charge high prices,\" said Randal Picker, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School.\n\nRegardless of who wins at the trial expected to last three weeks before Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, the case is all-but-certain to be appealed to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which last year reinforced the notion that dominant firms can charge high prices in a case involving Qualcomm Inc.\n\n\"Anticompetitive behavior is illegal under federal antitrust law. Hypercompetitive behavior is not,\" Circuit Judge Consuelo Callahan wrote in the court's opinion.\n\nA federal antitrust official, speaking anonymously because the official was not authorized to speak to the media, said that an Epic loss would dim the chances of the government pursuing a similar lawsuit against Apple.\n\nBREWING ANTITRUST DEBATE\n\nEpic's suit has ramped up pressure on Apple in the court of public opinion at a time when the iPhone maker's business practices are facing fresh scrutiny around the world.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice https://reut.rs/3vAq5sD is probing the company's practices, Reuters has reported, and regulators in the United Kingdom and Australia have opened probes or called for regulation.\n\nregulators last week accused Apple of distorting competition in the music streaming market, siding with Spotify Technology in the zone's first major anti-competition charge against Apple.\n\nEpic advertisements decrying Apple for taking such a big cut of revenue are landing aside those headlines.\n\n\"The public can understand these issues, and in many ways understand them better than these judges who have never played a game in their life,\" said Thomas Horton, a professor at the University of South Dakota School of Law.\n\nThe biggest threat to Apple's App Store is not lawsuits, but rather new laws regulating digital platforms, said Joel Mitnick, a partner at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft and a former U.S. Federal Trade Commission trial lawyer.\n\nEuropean lawmakers have already proposed legislation that could require Apple to allow developers to use their own payment systems, and consensus for new regulations is building in the United States as well.\n\nMitnick noted that concern about the power of big tech companies was bipartisan.\n\n\"If it were me, I would be looking at ways in which I could influence what might be inevitable changes to the rules under which (Apple) are going to operate,\" he said.",

The company later distanced itself from the report, saying he had not given a specific figure, although he had made it clear that EU leaders needed to invest to ensure a vibrant semiconductor industry.\n\nGelsinger, on his first European tour since taking charge, met European Commissioner Thierry Breton in Brussels on Friday. The visit followed the launch of a plan for Intel to invest $20 billion in chip production in the United States.\n\nOn top of that, Gelsinger is prospecting for a location for a plant in Europe that he says would back Breton's goal of doubling the region's share of global chip output to 20% over the next decade.\n\nBreton held talks earlier on Friday with\n\n(TSMC), the world's No.1 chip maker ahead of Korea's\n\nand Intel.\n\nIn separate tweets, Breton described his meeting with Intel's Gelsinger as an \"in-depth discussion\", while a video call with Maria Marced, president of TSMC Europe, had been a \"good exchange\".\n\n\"To meet current & future semiconductor industry demand, Europe will drastically increase production capacity - both on its own and through selected partnerships to ensure security of supply,\" said Breton.\n\nTSMC said the talks with Breton demonstrated its commitment to the region. \"Our desire to support our customers as fully as possible means that we're always willing to establish open communications with governments and regulators wherever they, and we, are based,\" the company said.\n\nThe Commission said Breton would hold further talks on May 4 with the CEOs of two Dutch semiconductor players: ASML, the leading maker of semiconductor lithography tools, and with chipmaker NXP.\n\nRecent disruption to semiconductor supply chains has added urgency to efforts to reduce import dependency, yet analysts caution Europe's shrunken technology base means it doesn't offer a viable market for a leading-edge plant, or \"fab\".\n\nIndustry and diplomatic sources say that, of the Big Three chipmakers, Intel is the only one so far to express concrete interest in Breton's goal of producing the most advanced chips in Europe.\n\nBreton's drive to attract a major foreign chipmaker has unnerved home-grown players, and he is also discussing the creation of a European semiconductor alliance that would bundle their interests.\n\nGermany's Infineon said on Friday it welcomed Breton's initiative to strengthen chip production in Europe.\n\n\"As financial resources are naturally limited it is important to discuss most urgent needs and the most reasonable ways of investment,\" Infineon said.\n\nGERMAN VISIT\n\nGelsinger, who met Economy Minister Peter Altmaier and Bavarian governor Markus Soeder on the German leg of his European tour, was quoted as saying Germany would be a suitable location for a potential European foundry.\n\n\"Geopolitically, if you're in Europe, you want to be in continental Europe,\" he told Politico, in remarks echoed in a second interview with German business daily\n\n.\n\n\"We think of Germany as a good candidate - not the only, but a good candidate - for where we might build our fabrication capabilities,\" he said, also indicating interest in the Benelux countries.\n\nIn Germany, Gelsinger also met executives from carmaker\n\nand telecoms operator Deutsche Telekom, Intel said.

        "text": "Over the past several months, we have brought to you stories about the massive movement of companies to the public cloud following the pandemic. When vast numbers of employees and customers needed to suddenly be serviced remotely, the public cloud seemed to be the way to go, given its scalability and agility.\n\nBut what if you are nervous about putting all your data, especially those that involve your intellectual property (IP), on the public cloud? What if you have heavy-duty, graphic-intensive workloads \u2013 like engineering services or building complex AI models with huge datasets that take a long time? The public cloud could be expensive in such instances.\n\nThis is where virtual desktop infrastructure (\n\n) has become popular. VDI is the technology that hosts desktop environments on a central server. In simple terms, all the data and applications reside in the company\u2019s IT infrastructure. And employees access that from anywhere and on any device.\n\n\u201cVDI allows you to protect your mission critical data, your IP, your R&D investments,\u201d Anirudh Shrotriya, MD of IT consulting firm SHRO Systems, said at the\n\nwebinar last week. \u201cWith data becoming so crucial, VDI allows data to be utilised, managed, backed up and stored, without it ever exiting the data centre,\u201d he said.\n\nManoj Kolekar, senior evangelist for technology at\n\n(\n\n), said VDI was a big reason why people could work remotely and yet do the same amount of business during the pandemic as before it. \u201cThere are many more customers going for VDI today, and those who are going for VDI are going for higher capacities,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving VDI is also cloud-like features that have been introduced. SHRO offers a menu of hardware and software options that customers can choose from, and these are delivered as a service. The IT infra will be in the customer\u2019s data centre, so they have control over it, but customers pay only a service charge and only for the extent of usage. No capital is locked up.\n\n\u201cAlso, if there are 300 users, we\u2019ll provision for 350 users, but charge only for 300. And if new capacity is required, we\u2019ll enable that capacity in hours through a remote manageability feature. You can scale up, or scale down,\u201d Shrotriya said.\n\nManaging the centralised systems have also become simple with hyperconverged infrastructure (\n\n). \u201cWith our HCI offering Simplivity, there\u2019s no need to manage different components. HCI merges everything \u2013 storage, networking, compute, hypervisor \u2013 as a single appliance. You don\u2019t need to understand storage, don\u2019t need to know how servers have to be configured. Upgrades require just a click,\u201d said Kolekar.\n\nWith VDI, you can get cloud-like economics, the same agility, scalability. But with on-premise performance, compliance and control. With VDI, you can get cloud-like economics, the same agility, scalability. But with on-premise performance, compliance and control.\n\nThe main thing about VDI is security and control.

        "text": "In quantum computing, the hardware steals the thunder because it is super cool physics. But the software developer community has also quietly made significant strides in building impressive stacks of open source quantum software.\n\nThe summer school for training developers and researchers in\n\n\u2019s quantum software development kit (SDK) Qiskit last year saw all the 1,000 slots for\n\nbeing lapped up in 24 hours. Of the 4,000 global participants, the highest participation was from India. Qiskit, an open source framework to implement quantum algorithms, is much in demand. \u201cWhen you write code in Qiskit, you are actually writing code in\n\n,\u201d says Abe Asfaw, global lead of quantum education at IBM Quantum, and Qiskit developer advocate.\n\nA classical computer handles the input and output tasks for the quantum computer. Qiskit helps write instructions called quantum circuits, which are what run on quantum computers. \u201cWhile code is \u2018compiled\u2019 to zeroes and ones for a classical computer, the quantum circuits get \u2018transpiled\u2019 for the quantum machine,\u201d says Asfaw. Transpiling is when you take source code written in one language and transform into another language. Qiskit does that transpiling, sends it over the cloud to the quantum computer, which then interprets the result at phenomenal speed. Both Qiskit and the transpiler are written in Python.\n\nQiskit has built-in modules for chemistry, physics, finance and machine learning. These modules are a step towards building practical applications. \u201cThese modules can help you by automatically creating quantum circuits that would solve your equations,\u201d says Asfaw.\n\nCanadian quantum computing company\n\nSystems has open sourced their software stack Ocean. \u201cWith Ocean SDK and our quantum application environment Leap, you can get started quickly on building applications,\u201d says Murray Thom, VP of software & cloud services at D-Wave.\n\nD-Wave has even opensourced an extension to IBM\u2019s Qiskit plugin to allow users to be able to program on two different types of quantum hardware. \u201cHere, Qiskit users get to compare work on both types of systems. As the technology gets better understood, and the technology stack on top of it with the software abstractions gets fuller and richer, I think there\u2019ll be more opportunities for people to be able to program across different types of quantum computers,\u201d says Thom.\n\nThom says we would fail quantum computing if everyone working on it ought to be a PhD. \u201cHaving a strong base in computer science and mathematics should give developers all the background skills that they need to learn. Like with classical computing, quantum too is going to be an ecosystem of different sets of users like machine learners, physicists, etc,\u201d he says.\n\nWe are at a stage where quantum computers are searching for applications. To be able to do this, we need people who don\u2019t just have a quantum mechanics background, but have some domain expertise. Qiskit will make it easy for them to write code on a quantum computer.

When her friend fell and hurt his leg badly, Gauri promptly cleaned his wound and stopped the bleeding before taking him back to school.\n\nNot surprisingly, Gauri, who grew up in the hills of Mussoorie, chose the medical profession. She trained as a dentist and started working at AIIMS when she was 21. \u201cI owe a lot to AIIMS\u2026it taught me humility,\u201d she says.\n\nAfter a couple of years at the country\u2019s premier medical institution, she took a sabbatical for six months. Not one to while away the hours, Gauri took up an opportunity offered by a business process management (\n\n) company that wanted a\n\nto help them adjudicate health claims in the US market.\n\n\u201cI had to lead a team of around 60 doctors and we had to fly to the US. I had to learn everything from scratch, right from managing a team to learning new subjects. It was thrilling,\u201d she says.

        "text": "The Indian IT services business has required employees to travel overseas, and even live there for extended periods \u2013 to understand client requirements, and to implement projects. Now, India is also building products for the world\u2019s consumers. The Mercedes-Benz R&D centre in India creates features for its cars that are used by its buyers globally. The Walmart centre here builds platforms that are improving the buying experience for US and Mexican consumers.\n\n\u2019s facility here has played a central role in building its new consumer digital bank Marcus.\n\nUnderstanding consumer behaviours and needs in global markets is a far more complex task than understanding enterprise IT requirements. And prior to Covid, it involved a lot of travelling to gain first hand knowledge of those societies and cultures.\n\n\u201cIt was necessary to meet customers and look at the environment that is not present in India,\u201d says Lalit Ahuja, CEO of ANSR, a company that helps MNCs set up engineering and R&D centres in India. Travel, he says, was even part of the employee onboarding process, where you joined and went to the home country to meet people, soak the culture and build networks.\n\nFor Chilean retailer Falabella, which has about 200 employees in India, 10% of its employees used to travel annually for about 4-5 weeks on an average and the frequency increased as one climbed the corporate ladder.\n\n\"I personally travelled 4-5 times a year, and at a level below, it was about 2-3 times,\u201d says Ashish Grover, the Bengaluru-based CIO of Falabella Group. Falabella\u2019s India centre has built the point-of-sale (\n\n) system for its stores in seven Latin American countries, and integrated its indigenous e-wallet in the retail ecosystem. The centre also manages the e-commerce operations and digs into data to provide more personal experiences.\n\nBut travel restrictions have made the whole process challenging. Grover says Falabella has invested in videos of stores that it shares with its employees for a better understanding. \"We had to find alternatives to white boarding and make virtual meetings more effective,\u201d he says. The technology teams from Chile and India also collaborated to pull off numerous cyber events to smoothen communication.\n\nOf the 6,000 people at Mercedes-Benz Research & Development India (\n\n), some 50-60 would go overseas for stints of 12-24 months, another 20-25 would go for training stints of upto a year, and another 1,000 would go on short trips to meet customers. \"We used to even send some managers to Stuttgart so that they work closely with the customers before putting them in leadership levels,\" says Mahesh Medhekar, vice president of HR at MBRDI. A lot of softwares developed in India used to be tested on test tracks in Germany. Medhekar says it was a different experience for the employees to be physically present during these tests. All of these activities have taken a hit. Today, a lot of work on autonomous and shared mobility is being done remotely from Bengaluru. Testings are being done in virtual environments.\n\nWalmart Global Tech India\u2019s country head and senior VP for technology, Hari Vasudev, says before Covid, employees used to travel a lot. \u201cThey would go for quarterly business meetings, to meet customers, visit stores. Travel used to be across the employee chain depending on the project life cycle. So we would have senior engineers, architects making trips round the year, for two weeks on an average,\" he says.\n\nNow, the centre, which has 6,500 people, has developed training material that uses augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) extensively when it onboards employees, to give them a look and feel of the stores and the distribution centres in the US, Canada and Mexico. It has also built an experience centre in Bengaluru.\n\nANSR\u2019s Ahuja says companies generally are making extensive use of videos, AR/VR. Efforts are being made to make even videos of activities otherwise considered trivial, like how to unload a trailer at store backrooms, or how cashiers check out at counters. \u201cEvery activity that was the cause for travel in the past is being segmented and converted into some sort of digital toolset,\" says Ahuja.\n\nHow sustainable is this model? John Kenny, director of\n\nServices \u2013 the India tech arm of Australia\u2019s biggest discount department retailer\n\n\u2013 says it isn\u2019t. \"It will have a significant impact if we cannot send team members to Melbourne to have the cultural experience, understand the teams there, understand how we operate,\" he says. KAS, which has about 150 employees in India, would previously have about 50 of them travelling to visit the stores and distribution centres.\n\nFalabella\u2019s Grover says travel and meeting peers would make the working model much smoother. Walmart\u2019s Vasudev says as the virtual tools improve, \u201ctravel may become less critical.\"\n\nAR/VR, VIDEOS, REMOTE TALKS ARE TRYING TO COMPENSATE FOR TRAVEL\n\nWe have done a lot of investments to create videos of our stores that we are sharing with the employees for them to understand the company remotely. Everything has become digital, right from store views to sharing customer data points. We have done a lot of investments to create videos of our stores that we are sharing with the employees for them to understand the company remotely.

We would urge you to listen to the webinar on the Times Techies Facebook page if you want to be a deep tech entrepreneur.\n\nDhruv, co-founder & CEO of Aether Biomedical, is just 22. His parents are doctors, and he too briefly thought he would become one. But in the second year of his MBBS, he dropped out, and extended work he had started in college \u2013 around assistive devices like prosthetics and exoskeletons \u2013 into a startup. The idea was to build a communication layer between these devices and the human body, so that the mind could be used to operate these devices. And also to communicate the muscular skeletal health of a person to a doctor so that appropriate therapies could be recommended.\n\nDhruv and team built sensors and algorithms. \u201cWhenever you think of doing something with your hand, there is a particular neural signature that arises in your muscle. Our sensors capture that signature, and process that to understand the exact intent of the user; and then the prosthetic hand does that particular action. Our system also provides tactile feedback to the user,\u201d Dhruv said. Today, Aether\u2019s 20-member team is divided between India and Poland. Dhruv moved to Poland to take advantage of Europe\u2019s robotics, motor systems, and gearing systems expertise, as also to leverage Europe\u2019s grants, investors and market.\n\nFor Anupama, it all started when she and two colleagues \u2013 all doing PhDs in microbiology/nanotechnology \u2013 one day decided they should apply their research work to real life applications. They found that hospital-acquired infections were a big issue in hospitals and for patients. With grants from government bodies, and later from\n\n, they developed high quality silver nanoparticles that could act against viruses, bacteria, and fungi. The process has been patented, and the product has passed all toxicity, safety, biocompatibility studies.\n\nTheir company, WeInnovate Biosolutions, is close to launching their first product, a urinary catheter impregnated with silver nanoparticles. \u201cUrinary catheters are a big source of hospital infections. So we chose to address that first. But we can use it in a number of other areas,\u201d Anupama said.\n\nDhruv & Anupama\u2019s advice on building deep tech ventures\n\n* Have clarity on why you have started the company, and then don\u2019t deviate from your prime focus\n\n* Look at the end-to-end journey of the customer. That will allow you to find problems which can be solved parallely with your product, and which will be able to provide a much better solution\n\n* Start building your network from Day 1.

They kept on stalling,\u201d a student at one of the\n\ns said, asking specifically that the IIM be not named.\n\nOver 1,000 students from MBA and Engineering colleges like IIT-Bombay, various IIMs, Wellingkar Mumbai, Delhi University, Symbiosis Pune, and Banaras Hindu University have filled out a form between April 28-April 30th to obtain an internship through Mission Summer Internship an initiative by Mission Helping Hands.\n\n\"These are the students whose internships have gotten revoked due to the second phase of\n\n,\" says Dr Shubhra Chakraborty, founder of Mission Helping Hands. The initiative placed 384 students for summer internships last year when the first wave of the pandemic hit. It received over 1,700 registration over a period of two weeks. \"Our number this year is going to be higher than last year. We launched just three days ago,\" says Chakraborty. ET could not independently verify how many such internship offers had been refused across the B-schools.\n\nThe IIM student said the withdrawal was announced just three days before his joining date despite repeatedly checking with the internal placement cell leading up to the start date.\n\n\u201cWe lost a month, I would have gone to some other company and interned,\u201d he said.\n\nFor many students who have a hefty education loan to repay, an internship is key to step up from the first to the second year.\n\nThe uncertainty is now causing them to take up any role on offer.\n\n\u201cPeople are trying to exploit us for work we do as an intern,\u201d said a 25-year-old who took to LinkedIn to find an internship after his offer was withdrawn. \u201cIt has become a joke at this point. They are hiring from IIM and they don\u2019t want to pay. That hurts.\u201d\n\nAnother student whose internship offered was not honoured said: \u201cWe are looking for new opportunities through our own contacts but it\u2019s difficult due to the ongoing pandemic.\u201d\n\nA 23-year-old MBA student from Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, was informed by a Mumbai-based ed-tech startup a week after joining that he would no longer be paid due to \u201cpandemic-related reasons.\u201d\n\n\u201cBusiness valuation can be done from home. I would have done it on my laptop even if I was working out of their Noida office. There is no difference,\u201d the student, who has taken an education loan of Rs 17 lakh, said.\n\nA friend\u2019s offer to intern at an NSE-listed manufacturing company was postponed indefinitely last week, he added.\n\nAccording to several students, Israel-based cybersecurity company Gamasec, which had plans to expand in India, withdrew scores of summer internship offers from IIMs and other B-schools.\n\nExplaining why, a former senior executive at the firm said the role had required them be physically present in its office in Bengaluru.\n\nE-commerce content startup Mason had to pull back summer internship offers in its marketing department as the team leads were infected with Covid-19.\n\nThe company has, however, on-boarded interns in operations and sales, said Kausambi Manjita, founder and CEO of the Accel and Lightspeed Venture Partners-funded startup.\n\n\u201cYou have an obligation to people who join to make them successful. It is worse for someone to join you especially fresh out of college and have nobody to support you,\u201d Manjita said, adding that placement cells at top-tier colleges were scrambling to help students.\n\nOn Friday, she received one such request from the placement cell of a top-tier management institute to onboard a student for a six-week internship, for free.\n\nA spokesperson for IIM Bangalore declined to comment on how many summer internship offers had been withdrawn.\n\nIIM Indore did not respond to similar queries.\n\nFull-time offers out\n\nSome MBA grads are still reeling from the economic after-effects of the first wave.\n\nShubham Ram, who completed his Post Graduate Diploma in Management from IIEBM-Indus Business School in Pune, was offered a job at HDFC Ergo last year with a joining date in June.\n\nThe company repeatedly deferred that for eight months, said Ram, who had taken a Rs 10 lakh student loan to fund his MBA dream.\n\nIn February this year, the company's HR person \u201cleft the WhatsApp group and revoked our offer,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey smashed our future. They should have informed us sooner or said we will come to you, but bharosa mat rakho (don't count on us),\u201d Ram, who is currently working night shifts at a small Pune-based company, added.\n\n\"HDFC ERGO has not revoked any offer formally made to any of the candidates,\" a company spokesperson said.\n\nHiring of fresh graduates for non-technology roles has also slowed slightly, according to Anshuman Das, CEO of CareerNet and Longhouse Consulting, which counts\n\n, Goldman Sachs and Tata Consultancy Services among its clients.",

They said the changes are needed to avoid a situation mobile phone manufacturers found themselves in, with only one of 16 handset companies achieving the target for FY21 even after making timely investments.\n\nThe companies said the government must keep in mind global supply chain difficulties and India\u2019s coronavirus crisis before setting ambitious output timelines for making laptops, tablets and servers, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\u201cPLI was conceptualised by the government in the pre-Covid era... but now there is a serious need to relook the scheme. The target should be revised or instead of four years we should be given five years to qualify for incentives,\u201d said Nitin Kunkolienker, president of the Manufacturers\u2019 Association for Information Technology.\n\nHe said the scheme is a two-way partnership between the government and the industry. The government would be the larger beneficiary, with 60% of the gains by way of foreign exchange, tax and non-tax revenue, employment, economic activity and social sector benefits.\n\n\u201cThe idea is not to prove that industry is failing to achieve, the idea is to prove that the government ensures the industry succeeds in leading this revolution,\u201d he said.\n\nQueries sent to HP, Samsung and Wistron did not elicit any response till press time. Dell and Rising Stars (Foxconn) declined to comment.\n\nAll but one of the first batch of 16 PLI companies that were approved to make mobile phones in October failed to meet their production targets for the first year ended March 31, 2021.\n\nApart from Samsung, the other companies have been asking the ministry to declare FY21 as a zero year because Covid-19-led restrictions delayed the setting up of production lines.\n\nOther industry associations have also put forward the industry\u2019s concerns, but the final decision on the matter rests with an empowered committee.\n\nThe ministry notified the scheme for laptops, tablets, PCs and servers in March, offering incentives worth Rs 7,325 crore to be disbursed over four years to five global and 10 domestic companies.\n\nAs per the guidelines, foreign companies must invest Rs 500 crore and achieve incremental sales of Rs 1,000 crore in the first year, Rs 2,500 crore in the second, Rs 5,000 crore in the third, and Rs 10,000 crore in the last year.\n\nFor domestic firms, the investment target is Rs 20 crore, while the incremental sales targets are Rs 50 crore, Rs 100 crore, Rs 200 crore and Rs 300 crore in four successive years.\n\nThe government also set a value addition criterion beginning in the second year, when companies must start assembling printed circuit boards in India. The following year, they must add battery packs and in the fourth year, the manufacture of power adaptors or cabinets/chassis/enclosures must be localised.\n\nUpon meeting all these criteria, the companies will receive an incentive of 1%-4% on incremental sales over the base year FY20. The last date for applications is April 31.\n\nThe market for laptops in India was about 7.5 million units in 2019-20, valued at Rs 33,950 crore, while for tablets it was 2.4 million units valued at Rs 3,500 crore, according to\n\n. The market for servers was 200,000 units worth Rs 9,100 crore. Almost 90% of this demand was met by imports.\n\n\u201cIndia\u2019s personal computer penetration at 15 per 1,000 people is significantly lower compared to the US (784 for 1,000 people) and China (41 per 1,000 people), and thus presents significant growth opportunities,\u201d according to the official scheme document.",

That could leave Google wary of spending its money on big acquisitions that are related to its existing businesses, as they would likely be blocked on antitrust grounds.\n\n\"Fears of an increased regulatory clampdown on the company might have seen Alphabet tread more carefully when deciding what to do with their cash pile,\" said Samuel Indyk, analyst at uk.Investing.com.\n\nAlphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat on Tuesday did not rule out making deals, though.\n\n\"Our primary use of capital continues to be to support organic growth in our businesses followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions and investments,\" she told analysts.\n\nBetting on unrelated businesses, while easier from a regulatory standpoint, would be unlikely to yield anything close to the returns enjoyed by Google. And spending on internal projects has limits too: Alphabet has sunk tens of billions into the its \"other bets,\" including autonomous vehicle company Waymo and blue-sky projects such as failed internet service Loon, but few are close to being viable businesses.\n\nLike many fast-growing tech companies, Alphabet has never paid a dividend, preferring instead to return cash to shareholders through buybacks. Alphabet bought back $31 billion in shares in 2020, 69 per cent more than the year before, according to\n\nanalyst Brent Thill.\n\nThe 2020 buyback amounted to 73 per cent of its free cash flow, up from 59 per cent in 2019, he said.\n\nUnlike dividends, which can lock a company into long-term fixed payouts to shareholders that are difficult to reduce, buybacks also give Alphabet the flexibility to adjust the flow of cash returned to investors at any time if it needs the money for other purposes.\n\nSome analysts say Alphabet shares are priced low relative to peers. Alphabet shares trade at about eight times sales over the last year, while shares of\n\nare at 10 times and\n\nat 12 times.\n\nTaking some shares off the market and stoking prices through the buyback, one of the largest ever on Wall Street and almost twice the company's previous highest authorization, could help close the gap with rivals.\n\n\"This (buyback) is a sign their stock is undervalued and a tougher regulatory environment for M&A,\" Thill said. Alphabet shares rose as much as 6.1 per cent to touch a record high of $2,431.38 on Wednesday.\n\nCompany leadership would benefit from higher shares under their new compensation plans. Five senior executives including Porat over the last year received stock awards that will vest, if at all, based on how Alphabet shares perform relative to the S&P 100 in the coming years.\n\nAlphabet is far from the only company with plenty of cash and antitrust and other challenges hampering its potential use.\n\n, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp and Facebook Inc have more than $300 billion combined.\n\nShare buybacks have been rising, both in the amount of repurchases and the number of companies doing them, though activity remains below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nAbout one-third of S&P 500 companies have issued quarterly results as of Tuesday, reporting $52 billion in buybacks in the first quarter, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst with S&P Dow Jones Indices. Those companies reported $42.8 billion in buybacks in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe calculation on buybacks versus dividends could change with U.S. President\n\n's new tax proposals, which aim to boost the levy on capital gains from stock investments but leave taxes on dividends and interest unchanged.",

        "text": "Move over\n\n, how about a\n\n?\n\nThat's the proposition being offered by the automobile arm of\n\n's largest conglomerate, Vingroup. It's betting big on the U.S. market with its VinFast line of cars and hoping that electric SUVs and a battery leasing model will be enough to woo consumers away from homegrown market leaders like Tesla and\n\nCo.\n\nA recent arrival on the automotive scene and the No. 5 car brand in Vietnam, VinFast is not short on ambition, with its sights set on a U.S. listing and a valuation of as much as $60 billion, according to two sources familiar with its plans.\n\nIt will launch in North America and Europe in 2022, CEO Nguyen Thi Van Anh told Reuters, joining a crowded field of players seeking to compete with Elon Musk's Tesla, including a slew of loss-making upstarts fuelled by a Wall Street fundraising craze.\n\n\"We are going to North America - U.S., Canada - and Europe at the same time. In Europe, we're going to Germany, France and the Netherlands,\" Van Anh said in an interview at the company's sprawling factory complex near the northern port of Haiphong.\n\nStanding behind VinFast is Vingroup, Vietnam's answer to a South Korean chaebol or catch-all conglomerate. Founded as an instant noodle business in post-Soviet Ukraine, the company's trajectory has mirrored that of Vietnam, one of Asia's fastest-growing economies, with interests spanning real estate, resorts, schools, hospitals and smartphones.\n\nEven with such formidable local backing, VinFast has its work cut out as industry giants such as General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen spend tens of billions of dollars to develop electric and driverless vehicles.\n\nFounded in 2017 with a team led by former General Motors Co executives, the company is aiming to compete on vehicle size and price - pitching an electric SUV that Van Anh described as \"more luxurious\" than those currently on offer.\n\nVinFast cars will also come with a battery leasing scheme that means the cost of the battery, one of the most expensive components of an electric car, will not be included in the final price.\n\n\"I'm going to give you a better product. I'm giving you an SUV. I'm giving you a more spacious car,\" said Van Anh, who will relocate next month from Hanoi to Los Angeles to head VinFast's U.S. operations.\n\nAccording to a presentation prepared by the company for potential investors, VinFast cars will be cheaper compared to other electric-vehicle (EV) models.\n\nA Tesla SUV sells for around $50,000, but Van Anh, who declined to discuss potential competitors, would not be drawn on how much a VinFast SUV would sell for. Two of the company's three electric models are destined for the United States, where the company is targeting annual sales of 45,000 cars, she said.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Sales of battery electric vehicles in the U.S. market - https://graphics.reuters.com/VIETNAM-VINFAST/rlgvdzdojvo/chart.png)\n\nAN EDGE OVER THE COMPETITION?\n\nThere is precedent for Asian carmakers cracking the U.S. market. Toyota in the 1970s and\n\nin the 1980s overcame initial scepticism with products that eventually stole market share from U.S. manufacturers.\n\nVinFast, which achieved annual sales of around 30,000 units last year in Vietnam and has yet to make a profit, faces an uphill battle.\n\n\"Their biggest challenge is convincing consumers that they have a solid product and a compelling value proposition,\" said Bill Russo, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automobility Ltd and a former Chrysler executive.\n\n\"The product itself looks to have the right appearance and features, but this will only get you in the game. Winning requires a technology or business model edge over the competition.\"\n\nThe company is betting its battery leasing scheme - where customers would pay a monthly amount roughly equivalent to what the average consumer might spend on petrol - will win over U.S. customers.\n\nWhen the battery, which uses cells from South Korea's Samsung SDI, is at 70% of its full lifespan, VinFast will replace it, Van Anh said.\n\nA similar scheme has already been rolled out in China by Tencent-backed electric vehicle maker Nio, whose ES6 SUV has a starting price of around 358,000 yuan ($55,272).\n\nNo EV maker can compete with Tesla in the near future, according to Michael Dunne, chief executive of automotive consulting firm ZoZo Go, pointing to the U.S. company's across-the-board strengths.\n\n\"But the good news is that companies like VinFast do not have to beat Tesla to win. All they really need to do is convert a portion of the 65 million consumers who bought gasoline-powered cars in 2020 to switch over the electrics,\" said Dunne.\n\nVinFast, whose manufacturing facility in Vietnam has the capacity to churn out 250,000 cars a year, is planning on conducting most of its U.S. sales online, removing the need for a costly dealership network. It has had 15,000 advance orders so far for its VF e34 electric car in Vietnam.\n\nThe company has hired Jeremy Snyder, a 10-year Tesla veteran, as its U.S. Chief Growth Officer.\n\nSnyder told Reuters he was VinFast's first employee on the ground in the United States but, between full-time employees and consultants, the company now has around 100 people working there.\n\n\"It's very exciting to bring Vietnam and the United States closer through VinFast,\" he said.\n\nTAPPING THE SPAC?\n\nVingroup's founder, Pham Nhat Vuong, Vietnam's richest man, has pledged to invest $2 billion of his own money into the car division and Vingroup has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into VinFast by issuing international bonds and selling off stakes in other units.\n\nBut expansion over the years has pushed up Vingroup's debt and losses at some of its ventures have squeezed its cashflow. To turbocharge its growth, VinFast will need more cash. The company is looking at tapping into a funding frenzy in the United States, where investors, including some of the world's biggest money managers, have poured billions into auto startups via blank-check companies known as special-purpose acquisition companies or SPACs.\n\nThree sources with direct knowledge of the plans said VinFast was leaning towards a SPAC, although Van Anh declined to comment on when or how the company would generate funding in the United States.\n\nOfficials from the\n\nwill visit Vietnam soon to meet with Vingroup executives about its efforts to list, two separate sources said. If VinFast does list in the United States it will be the first Vietnamese company to do so. \"When it happens, how it happens, whether by SPAC or by another method, we'll make the right decision at the same time,\" said Van Anh.\n\nThere are hundreds of SPACs searching for companies to take public and investors are desperate to identify the next Tesla, whose stratospheric market rally has made Musk one of the world's richest men.\n\nNio, which made a net loss last year of $860 million, has a market cap of around $67 billion, according to its New York stock listing and sold just under 44,000 cars last year, close to what VinFast is targeting in the United States.\n\nA stream of EV-related startups notched up multi-billion dollar valuations last year despite not having products ready to sell but their shares have taken a knocking recently.\n\nVinFast likes to distinguish itself from other EV startups.\n\n\"If you look at some of the SPAC deals that already happened, they do not really have what we currently have,\" said Van Anh.\n\n\"Even if we don't have a product in the world market, we have the products here.\"",

        "text": "For at least the third time since the beginning of this year, the U.S. government is investigating a hack against federal agencies that began during the Trump administration but was only recently discovered, according to senior U.S. officials and private sector\n\n.\n\nIt is the latest so-called supply chain cyberattack, highlighting how sophisticated, often government-backed groups are targeting vulnerable software built by third parties as a stepping-stone to sensitive government and corporate computer networks.\n\nThe new government breaches involve a popular virtual private network (VPN) known as Pulse Connect Secure, which hackers were able to break into as customers used it.\n\nMore than a dozen federal agencies run Pulse Secure on their networks, according to public contract records. An emergency cybersecurity directive last week demanded that agencies scan their systems for related compromises and report back.\n\nThe results, collected on Friday and analyzed this week, show evidence of potential breaches in at least five federal civilian agencies, said Matt Hartman, a senior official with the U.S. Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency.\n\n\"This is a combination of traditional espionage with some element of economic theft,\" said one cybersecurity consultant familiar with the matter. \"We've already confirmed data exfiltration across numerous environments.\"\n\nThe maker of Pulse Secure, Utah-based software company Ivanti, said it expected to provide a patch to fix the problem by this Monday, two weeks after it was first publicized. Only a \"very limited number of customer systems\" had been penetrated, it added.\n\nOver the last two months, CISA and the\n\nhave been working with Pulse Secure and victims of the hack to kick out the intruders and uncover other evidence, said another senior U.S. official who declined to be named but is responding to the hacks. The FBI,\n\nand\n\ndeclined to comment.\n\nThe U.S. government's investigation into the Pulse Secure activity is still in its early stages, said the senior U.S. official, who added the scope, impact and attribution remain unclear.\n\nSecurity researchers at U.S. cybersecurity firm FireEye and another firm, which declined to be named, say they've watched multiple hacking groups, including an elite team they associate with China, exploiting the new flaw and several others like it since 2019.\n\nIn a statement last week, Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said China \"firmly opposes and cracks down on all forms of cyber attacks,\" describing FireEye's allegations as \"irresponsible and ill-intentioned.\"\n\nThe use of VPNs, which create encrypted tunnels for connecting remotely to corporate networks, has skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet with the growth in VPN usage so too has the associated risk.\n\n\"This is another example in a recent pattern of cyber actors targeting\n\nin widely used VPN products as our nation largely remains in remote and hybrid work postures,\" said Hartman.\n\nThree cybersecurity consultants involved in responding to the hacks told Reuters that the victim list is weighted toward the United States and so far includes defense contractors, civilian government agencies, solar energy companies, telecommunications firms, and financial institutions.\n\nThe consultants also said they were aware of less than 100 combined victims so far between them, suggesting a fairly narrow focus by the hackers.\n\nAnalysts believe the malicious operation began around 2019 and exploited older flaws in Pulse Secure and separate products made by cybersecurity firm Fortinet before invoking the new vulnerabilities.\n\nHartman said the civilian agency hacks date back to at least June 2020.\n\nHACKING THE SUPPLY\n\nA recent report by the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank, studied 102 supply chain hacking incidents and found they surged the last three years. Thirty of the attacks came from government-backed groups, primarily in Russia and China, the report said.\n\nThe Pulse Secure response comes as the government is still grappling with the fallout of three other cyberattacks.\n\nThe first is known as the SolarWinds hack, in which suspected Russian government hackers commandeered the company's network management program to burrow inside nine federal agencies.\n\nA weakness in\n\n's email server software, named Exchange, exploited by a different group of Chinese hackers, also required a massive response effort, although there was ultimately no impact to federal networks, according to U.S. officials.\n\nThen a weakness at a maker of programming tools called Codecov left thousands of customers exposed inside their coding environments, the company disclosed this month.\n\nSome government agencies were among the customers which had the Codecov hackers take credentials for further access to code repositories or other data, according to a person briefed on the investigation. Codecov, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on that case.\n\nThe U.S. plans to address some of these systemic issues with an upcoming executive order that will require agencies to identify their most critical software and promote a \"bill of materials\" that demands a certain level of digital security across products sold to the government.\n\n\"We think [this is] the most impactful way to really impose costs on these adversaries and make it that much harder,\" said the senior U.S. official.",

The unit increased revenue 32% to $13.5 billion, ahead of estimates of $13.2 billion.\n\nAdding to Amazon's revenue was its growing chain of physical stores, including Whole Foods Market and its first overseas cashier-less convenience shop, opening last month in the London Borough of Ealing. Amazon delved further into healthcare as well with an online doctors-visit service for employers, representing another area it is aiming to disrupt after retail, enterprise technology and Hollywood.\n\nProfit more than tripled to $8.1 billion.\n\nAmazon, which saw its stock price nearly double in the first part of 2020 as it benefited from the pandemic, has this year underperformed the S&P 500 market index. Its shares were up about 8.5% year to date versus the index's 13% gain.\n\nAt the same time, spending on COVID-19 and logistics has chipped away at Amazon's bottom line. The company has poured money into buying cargo planes and securing new warehouses, aiming to place items closer to customers to speed up delivery. It said Wednesday it planned to hike pay for over half a million employees, costing more than $1 billion - and it is still hiring for tens of thousands more positions.\n\nAmazon said it expects operating income for the current quarter to be between $4.5 billion and $8 billion, which assumes about $1.5 billion of costs related to COVID-19.\n\nWhile far behind ad sales leaders\n\nand Alphabet Inc's Google, Amazon is winning business because advertisers' placements often result directly in sales, reaching customers who are on Amazon with an intention to shop. Amazon said ad and other sales rose 77% to $6.9 billion, ahead of analysts' estimate of $6.2 billion.",

Automakers and their suppliers, with \"just-in-time\" production lines that can more easily be spun up or changed to produce different varieties of parts, have not.\n\nApple said Wednesday that it would lose $3 billion to $4 billion in sales in the current quarter due to limited supplies of certain older\n\n.\n\nStill, that represents just a few percent of Apple's projected sales of $68.94 billion for the fiscal third quarter, according to Refinitiv revenue estimates, compared to a massive 50% production hit at Ford.\n\nGerman automaker Daimler also warned last week that the chip shortage would likely carry over to next year.\n\nThe supply bottleneck threatens to derail the country's fragile economic recovery.\n\nFord Chief Executive Jim Farley singled out a March fire at a Renesas Electronics Corp plant in Japan as a key factor in its chip shortfall.\n\nBut some of the problems at Ford and other automakers are the result of their own decisions. Many cut orders a year ago when the pandemic hit, and then were caught short when auto demand rebounded much more quickly and strongly than anticipated.\n\nFarley gave a bleak outlook Wednesday, saying that even though the company was working \"24/7\" to address the issues, \"there are more whitewater moments ahead.\" The problems could persist into 2022, he added.\n\nApple, which is famous for its supply chain management and has more buying power than any other company, has avoided problems so far in meeting surging demand in part by burning through supply buffers, Chief Executive Tim Cook told investors on a conference call Wednesday.\n\nProblems procuring chips made with older-generation technologies will catch up with Apple in the current quarter, Cook said, noting that other industries also use such chips. He did not cite automakers specifically, but many of their components are based on such earlier-generation tech.\n\nApple expects the problems to mostly affect\n\nand Macs - two product lines that have sold well as work-from-home tools during the pandemic but whose sales are a fraction of Apple's cash cow, the\n\n. Ford, by contrast, is facing production shutdowns for its most profitable product, the F-150 pickup.\n\nThe uneven impact of the chip shortage was evident in mobile phone chip supplier Qualcomm Inc's results announced Wednesday: The company said business was booming on strong demand for smartphone processors and 5G communications chips.\n\nMobile phone processors are not suffering the same kind of manufacturing capacity shortage as auto chips because they are made with more advanced production technology that chipmakers have spent heavily on in recent years.\n\nMobile phones do, however, require some older-technology chips in addition to their advanced processors.\n\nalso announced strong earnings and said it expected to see a hit to smartphone sales in the current quarter due to the chip shortage. But profits at its chip division are expected to be robust.\n\nIn cases where advanced chip production technology faces bottlenecks, semiconductor firms are finding some ways to mitigate them. Advanced Micro Devices Inc on Tuesday raised its annual sales targets, with CEO Lisa Su saying the company saw no problems in secure the supplies needed to meet the targets.\n\nTo address a shortage in so-called \"substrates\" - a substance used to help put delicate silicon chips into tougher packaging so they can be placed on circuit boards inside electronic devices - she said AMD invested money into its substrate suppliers to secure dedicated capacity.\n\n\"We're a bigger part of our suppliers' businesses, and we're looking for opportunities to help our partners get the capacity that we need in place,\" Su told Reuters in an interview. \"We started that last year, and we're going to continue.\"\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin\n\nTop Comment",

        "title": "Asus ROG Phone 5 review: The gaming smartphone just got better",
        "text": "critic rating 4\n\nTop Features Soldi performance Good battery life Game-centric features\n\nAsus launched its first ROG branded smartphone back in 2018. The smartphone that practically introduced the gaming smartphone category to the world. Sure, it wasn\u2019t the first to inherit the gaming DNA from the parent company, but it was certainly more popular among the masses.\n\nThen, came the\n\n2 and ROG Phone 3. The latter brought significant yet practical improvement in terms of performance, features, design as well as game-centric features.\n\nAsus usually used to launch its ROG Phone in the second half of the year after the launch of Qualcomm\u2019s \u2018+\u2019 series processors. But, creating an exception, the company launched its\n\nin the first half.\n\nIt still comes with Qualcomm's latest and most powerful mobile chipset, it still carries the gaming DNA from all the previous generations and it still is a very capable gaming smartphone, at least on paper. Also, the launch price of Rs 49,999 appears to very promising for a smartphone with this kind of specifications.\n\nBut, what\u2019s new with the ROG Phone 5? Does it bring any significant improvement over the ROG Phone 3 or it is just a minor upgrade that can be easily skipped? Let\u2019s find out in our in-depth review.\n\nAsus ROG Phone 5: Design\n\nROG Phones makes its presence felt. That is the case with ROG Phone 5 as well. It carries the same bold and striking glass sandwich design as the previous ROG Phone. Even though Asus has been working hard to tone down its \u201cgamers\u201d design language for most of the ROG products including smartphones, the ROG Phone 5 still retains that but it feels more muted now.\n\nThe overall design of ROG Phone 5 is still far away from being called a boring design. The back panel now feels more premium with the new off-centered ROG logo, Republic of Gamers branding and that hexagonal camera module at the top that carries the triple camera setup.\n\nAlso, the new dot-matrix-styled ROG logo looks good and works as it used to on other ROG Phones. We just wished that Asus should have retained the regular LED RGB logo from ROG Phone 3 instead of this.\n\nAt the front, the smartphone carries a 6.78-inch display with FHD+ resolution along with dual front-firing speaker and front camera sensor. The ROG Phone 5 is built like a tank. It is heavy at 238 grams, but feels solid in hand.\n\nThe right side of the phone houses the volume rocker and power button which has a red accent to it. It is a tall phone and keeping that in mind, Asus has positioned the power button at almost centre for better reach even while holding the phone single-handedly. The right metal housing has engraved shoulder buttons also known as AirTriggers.\n\nThe left side of the phone gets a secondary USB port and a POGO connector for connecting accessories, etc. Then there\u2019s a Red coloured SIM card tray. At the bottom, the phone just has the primary microphone, headphone jack and primary USB Type-C port.\n\nAsus ROG Phone 5: Display\n\nThe ROG Phone 5 features a 6.78-inch FHD+ resolution Samsung-sourced AMOLED panel. Now, this is a 144Hz AMOLED panel, a first on any smartphone. Other features of the display include 300hz touch sampling rate, 24.3ms touch latency, 800nits of peak brightness, HDR10+ support and 111% DCI-P3 gamut coverage.\n\nIn our test, it is an absolutely gorgeous display to look at. Watching movies or playing games or doing anything else is comforting with those deep blacks and high contrast ratio. The colours are bright, vivid and punchy as well. The HDR10 support further adds to it.\n\nBut, the 800nits of peak brightness does feel a little less when using the smartphone outdoors. But, the higher frame rate easily makes up for it. It is one of the best displays we have seen on any smartphone.\n\nAsus\n\n: New chip and more\n\nThe ROG Phone 5 is powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 SoC paired with up to 12GB RAM and 256GB storage.\n\nOn paper, this is among the best configurations you can buy on any Android smartphone. So it checks the top-notch internals box. But, what it\u2019s like using it in the real world. Well, for starters, you won\u2019t find any major improvements in day-to-day usages. The opening and closing of apps and games is smooth. There\u2019s no lag or stutter no matter what.\n\nWe tested it by running multiple apps and games at the same time including COD Mobile, Chrome with around 20 tabs, Kine master video editing app, Lightroom and a couple of social media apps. The memory management is good here. Even after shuffling around with multiple apps, the KineMaster was still rendering the video in the background. Also, the Lightroom loaded up pretty fast without any lag or delay.\n\nThe Asus ROG Phone 5 brings improvements where it matters the most. It\u2019s no doubt among the most powerful Android smartphones, but the way it handles things is quite different from others.\n\nThe real potential we saw while doing creators tasks like shooting, editing a video or while editing a photo in Adobe Lightroom. A fast processor paired with vast storage and plenty of RAM can do miracles and this phone is almost there.\n\nAsus has almost managed to tame the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipset. Almost because the phone heats up a little and that eventually affects the performance of the smartphone. But, it is barely noticeable. Also, the new Aeroactive Cooler comes in handy in such situations and it does exactly what it is meant to do.\n\nThe smartphone does not become uncomfortable to hold at any moment. We tested this by playing COD Mobile at its best possible graphics settings for around 5 hours and heating here is not that bad.\n\nThe ROG Phone 5 is everything the ROG Phone 3 was but also comes with every piece of software tricks that Asus could put in a smartphone.\n\nFor example, the ROG Phone 3 has multi-zone AirTriggers, the ROG Phone 5 has that, but it is now more sensitive, offers better feedback and Asus has also added multiple motion triggers options as well.\n\nAnother good example is the customisation option using the updated Armory Crate, Game Genie, etc. Though basic functionality remains the same, it still allows users to customise the smartphones overall performance by offering a pre-configured option including a new X Mode+ which now works with Aeroactive Cooler only.\n\nIt also offers core-level system performance tweaking options for individual games. Users can customise each and everything from Network performance, display, CPU and GPU performance using the Armory Crate app. But, things do not end there. Asus has also opened up the core performance tuning options where it allows users to tweak some settings which 99% of smartphone makers do not even want to see.\n\nWe understand that Asus is trying to cater to a wide range of audience by offering both pre-configured performance modes for the muggle world who have no clue what\u2019s going on in the magical world. Simply put, the level of customisation the phone offers, a person who knows what he/she is doing can unleash the true potential of the ROG Phone 5 and Qualcomm Snapdragon 888.\n\nAlso, the ROG Phone 5 now comes with a headphone jack with DAC support. The company claims to offer better sound output. We tested that as well by using ROG Cetra II Core earphones. Which, by the way, sounds really good and offers deep and punchy bass output. The real deal with the Cetra II Core is the stereo separation it offers which makes the gaming experience much better.\n\nThen there are dual front-firing speakers backed by Dirac audio. They are even louder and bassier than the ROG Phone 5. We are glad that Asus has found a way to make things louder without losing much on quality.\n\nGaming performance\n\nWe have already talked much about what ROG Phone 5 is capable of. Gaming is among its core strengths and the advantage here is evident. We played around a dozen different titles on ROG Phone 5. Entry-level games with a less demanding nature ran at maximum FPS. Demanding titles like CoD Mobile, Shadow Fight 3, NOVA, Free Fire, Asphalt 9 and Shadowgun War Games -- Online PvP FPS.\n\nEvery game we opened greeted us with excellent loading speed, almost instantaneous. Post that most games defaulted to maximum graphics settings and delivered maximum support FPS by them. The graphics quality, details, shadows, etc are also very well represented. We never even felt any rendering delay while playing fast-paced games like Asphalt 9, CoD Mobile, etc. Also, all games worked with the AirTrigger and Motion gestures and let\u2019s admit, once you get habituated to shoulder buttons on a smartphone, there\u2019s no going back.\n\nBut, there\u2019s more to it. Asus ROG Phone 5 also supports several accessories including Aeroactive Cooler and Kunai Gamepad. We tested both, while the cooler works flawlessly as already mentioned, we are not very convinced by the Kunai Gamepad.\n\nFirst, it didn\u2019t work with some titles, second, the configuration process is very complicated and it took a good amount of time to set this up for the game where it worked. We tested it with both Bluetooth and USB mode and the results are the same. But again, once everything was set and got used to it. There\u2019s no going back. The level of comfort it offers while playing, the controller experience is really good.\n\nJumping to the software part, Asus usually likes to keep it clean with bare minimum apps with near to stock Android experience. Though themes are there and Asus also lets users choose whether they want to use the ROG theme or keep it stock Android while setting up the device.\n\nThe software experience is smooth and fluid. There are few apps like Armory Crate and Game Genie which come pre-installed, but they are necessary apps. The phone also comes with most of the features like dark mode, dual apps, app lock, etc.\n\nThe 6000mAh battery is good and it lasted for an entire day with plenty left for next under medium usages. If you wish to play long gaming sessions, then you might want to keep the device plugged in and use the power pass-through feature to keep it connected and charged without damaging the battery.\n\nThe phone also comes with couple of other tricks like scheduled charging, limit battery charging level and more.\n\nThe included 65W adapter charges the smartphone to full in just under 1.5 hours.\n\nAsus ROG Phone 5: Camera\n\nThe only department, where we think Asus left untouched is the camera. It features the same camera setup as ROG Phone 3, which is both a good and bad thing. The camera offers mixed experience. But before that let\u2019s take a look at the camera specs and features.\n\nThe ROG Phone 5 features a triple rear camera setup that consists of a 64MP primary sensor, a 13MP ultra-wide sensor and a 5MP macro sensor.\n\nThe primary 64MP sensor offers reasonable image quality with a good amount of detail in both daylight and low light conditions. We just wished to have a little more dynamic range and colour accuracy here. Sometimes the camera captured Orange colour as Purple which was so weird for us.\n\nThe ultrawide 13MP sensor and 5MP sensor also does a decent job here in both daylight and lowlight conditions.\n\nThe ROG Phone 5 can shoot up to 8K videos and we tried recording a few clips using the primary sensor at 8K resolution and the video quality has the same story to tell as the image quality.\n\nThe smartphone also comes with several shooting modes like Motion tracking, Pro, Macro, Pro Video, Night, Portrait, etc.\n\nAs far as the camera app is concerned, it is fast and fluid. The mode placement is within the reach and so are the shutter and gallery buttons.\n\nWell, the ROG Phone 5 features a decent set of rear camera that offers acceptable outputs in both photos and videos. But, we certainly feel that for a smartphone of this price, there should have been more.\n\nROG Phone 5: Verdict\n\nAt a starting price of Rs 49,999, the ROG Phone 5 is a pretty solid smartphone. It offers almost everything a gaming smartphone should offer without sacrificing much on other aspects like designs and features. At the same time, it misses out on something which also matters to people who are willing to pay this hefty price. For instance, the camera should have been better than the previous generation.\n\nKeeping everything aside for a moment, the ROG Phone 5 offers everything any user might want in their smartphone whether gamer or not gamer. Having said that, it is also true that ROG Phone 5 stands still with its gaming DNA.\n\nFor the asking price, it is unlike any other smartphone and it has a lot to offer which you won\u2019t find anywhere else. It has the right design, performance and display which is truly amazing. It is also among the most customisable smartphones in the market.\n\nWho should get this smartphone? Anyone who\u2019s looking for a smartphone that offers powerful performance, good display, decent camera and good battery life can definitely go for Asus ROG Phone 5 without thinking much about the bold design.\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin",

        "title": "Realme 8 5G review: Brings 5G on a budget",
        "text": "critic rating 3\n\nTop Features Battery life Reliable performance Solid build\n\nWhen a brand launches smartphones at regular intervals then the old adage quantity over quality does come to mind.\n\nhas been hyperactive in launching phones but mercifully hasn\u2019t fallen prey to the ill-fated mantra of quantity over quality. The latest phone to from the Realme stable is the\n\nand comes shortly after the non-5G variant. As the name suggests, the phone has 5G capabilities making it future proof. But what about the present? How does the\n\n5G \u2014 launched at starting price of Rs 14,999 \u2014 manage to hold in a competitive market? We used the Realme 8 5G for a while to see how the phone fares. Read our review to find out more.\n\n: Design and display\n\nCompared to the Realme 8, the 5G variant of the device is slightly thicker. The\n\nweighs about 185 grams and is 8.5mm thick. The smartphone doesn\u2019t feel bulky and is easy to hold.\n\nRealme has opted for a glossy back panel for the Realme 8 5G, which means that be ready to see a lot of fingerprints and smudges. Some might find the phone slippery but Realme has given a case with the smartphone, which will come in handy for a lot of people. There\u2019s no Dare to Leap branding on the Realme 8 5G which is quite prominent on the non-5G variant.\n\nPutting 5G connectivity in a budget phone means Realme has made a few compromises. For instance, there\u2019s no in-display fingerprint sensor \u2014 it is found in the non-5G variant \u2014 and here the power button doubles up as fingerprint scanner. It is responsive enough and worked every time quite quickly. The button placement is quite standard \u2014 volume and SIM tray on the left and power button on the right. You can put two nano SIMs and a microSD card in the SIM tray.\n\nRead More:\n\nIt\u2019s surprising to see Realme give a single speaker \u2014 placed at the bottom along with type-C charging port and 3.5mm headphone jack \u2014 as a lot of\n\ngive dual speakers at this price point. Having said that, the speaker does produce relatively crisp audio.\n\nThe Realme 8 5G doesn\u2019t get an Super AMOLED display which is incidentally found in the non-5G variant of the smartphone. Instead you get a 6.5-inch IPS LCD display with full HD+ resolution. Despite not getting an AMOLED display, Realme 8 5G gets 90Hz refresh rate on the panel. Scrolling on the smartphone and switching between apps is quite smooth. The display is bright enough but colours aren\u2019t that accurately reproduced. Realme has given WideVine L1 support which makes watching HD content quite pleasant. The display has a punch-hole design for the selfie camera.\n\nRealme 8 5G review: Performance\n\nThe Realme 8 5G comes with MediaTek Dimensity 700 SoC. We haven\u2019t used a phone with this processor earlier so we weren\u2019t sure what to expect. The Realme 8 5G is an extremely capable device when it comes to performance. Basic routine tasks and multitasking was quite a breeze and the 8GB RAM has a lot to do with it. The smartphone Realme 8 5G comes in two storage variants: 4GB+128GB which costs Rs 14,999 and the 8GB+128GB variant is priced at Rs 16,999. Realme has given two colour options, Supersonic Blue and Supersonic Black. Our review unit was the 8GB RAM variant in SuperSonic Black colour.\n\nYou won\u2019t notice any lags or stutters at any time on this phone. We didn\u2019t find any problem with using the smartphone on a daily basis. Routine tasks like browsing the web, scrolling social media sites and even gaming is handled quite well. The phone didn\u2019t heat up even once in our time with it. Realme 8 5G is a good example of how MediaTek has upped its game and it\u2019s no surprise to see a lot of brands opting for its chipsets.\n\nAll\n\nrun on Realme UI and this one is no different. It\u2019s a clean looking UI but comes with its fair share of pre-installed apps. You will find at least a dozen apps which you might or might not need but mercifully they can be removed. Realme UI looks clean and you won\u2019t get or see ads like you do on Xiaomi\u2019s MIUI.\n\nThere are a lot of customisation options available on the smartphone\u2019s UI and Android 11.\n\nRealme 85G review: Camera\n\nLike most phones in this segment, Realme 8 5G has a triple camera setup with a 48MP primary sensor, a 2MP macro sensor and a 2MP black and white portrait lens. On the front, there\u2019s a 16MP shooter. It\u2019s a bit surprising to not to find an ultra-wide lens, considering\n\nhas it and so does the Redmi Note 10.\n\nNevertheless, the three cameras that are present are just about there. You won\u2019t see any faults with images clicked in broad daylight. There\u2019s enough detail and colour but the dynamic range of the Realme 8 5G camera doesn\u2019t really get it right. When the lighting is bad, there\u2019s not enough detail and ample amount of grains. Despite having a Night mode the images don\u2019t really stand out. The same has to be said about the macro sensor \u2014 low-light photography isn\u2019t really a talking point. You will struggle to autofocus on most occasions but once you do, there is enough detail in shots clicked in daylight.\n\nThe selfie camera does its job quite well in most lighting conditions. If camera is one of the big reasons why you buy a smartphone, then this isn\u2019t the phone for you. Sure, it will click photos that can be posted on social media platforms and the daylight photography is actually reasonably good. But overall the camera setup isn\u2019t much to write home about.\n\nRealme 8 5G review: Battery\n\nRealme 8 5G comes with a 5000mAh battery and it is one of the strongest points of the smartphone. With moderate usage, you can easily last 36 hours and with heavy usage it will last for 24 hours at least. Even while gaming on the phone, the battery doesn\u2019t really drain that quickly.\n\nRead More:\n\nHowever, the Realme 8 5G comes with a 18W fast charger which means that it takes more than two hours to charge the phone. It\u2019s again a bit of a surprise since the Realme 8 comes with a 30W fast charger.\n\nRealme 8 5G review: Verdict\n\nTo ensure that the phone is future-ready \u2014 5G support \u2014 Realme has made quite a few compromises compared to the non-5G variant of the smartphone. The Realme 8 has a better display and better charging capabilities. Realme 8 5G misses out on both features.The phone\u2019s design is quite nice but it is a fingerprint magnet. The camera performance leaves a lot to be desired on most counts. Having said that, if you are looking for a phone that handles routine tasks capably and easily then this could be the phone for you. Realme has done a fine job on making a phone that will please most users who buy devices for good performance and little else. Starting at Rs 14,999, Realme has got 5G on a budget but don\u2019t forget that there\u2019s still no clarity on when 5G will be ready in India. Realme 8 5G is a phone that is \u2018future-ready\u2019 but misses out on some of the features that matter in the present.\n\nRealme 8 5G 128GB 8GB RAM Camera 48 MP + 2 MP + 2 MP Display 6.5 inches (16.51 cm) Performance MediaTek Dimensity 700 MT6833 Ram 8 GB Storage 128 GB Battery 5000 mAh Price in india 18999 see full specifications \u276f\n\nRealme 8 5G Camera 48 MP + 2 MP + 2 MP Display 6.5 inches (16.51 cm) Performance MediaTek Dimensity 700 MT6833 Ram 4 GB Storage 128 GB Battery 5000 mAh Price in india 16999 see full specifications \u276f\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin",

        "title": "Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro Max review: The utility player",
        "text": "critic rating 3.5\n\nXiaomi has been facing stiff competition in the segment which practically was pioneered by the company. Smartphone brands like Realme, Nokia, Samsung have been launching products in the price range with the latest possible feature in the price range which was once dominated by Xiaomi.\n\nXiaomi\u2019s\n\nis always a strong contender in this space and now the series has three new smartphones --\n\n,\n\nand\n\n.\n\nTalking about the Pros, they are more or less the same in terms of features, performance and battery. The major difference between the two is in terms of display size and the camera.\n\nThe smartphone in question here is the Redmi Note 10 Pro Max. It is the cheapest smartphone in the market to feature a 108MP primary sensor and is also the third smartphone from Xiaomi to rock this lens.\n\nWe have been using this smartphone for a while and here\u2019s how it performs in the real world.\n\n: Design and display\n\nXiaomi has been pushing the limits when it comes to design with their smartphones. The Redmi Note 10 Pro Max is a simple-looking smartphone, yet it feels fresh and elegant. The 108MP quad-camera housing at the back is slightly protruding, however, the stacked two-layer design makes it look premium.\n\nThe camera housing has two segments. A bigger rectangular housing that has another small rectangular housing carries all four sensors. The bigger housing also has a LED flash and laser autofocus sensor.\n\nThough the entire smartphone is made out of plastic, the drift from the dual-tone paints and gradients feels like a step in the right direction.\n\nAt the top, there\u2019s an IR sensor, a secondary microphone for noise cancellation, a speaker grille and a headphone jack. The bottom has another speaker grille, USB Type-C port and primary microphone.\n\nRead More:\n\nIt is surprising to see a dual speaker setup on a smartphone of this price. Kudos to Xiaomi for retaining the headphone jack and adding a second speaker.\n\nXiaomi has cut some corners as well. For instance, there\u2019s no in-display fingerprint scanner. Instead, the company has gone with a side-mounted physical fingerprint scanner which also doubles up as the power button. Just above the power button, the volume rocker is placed. We found the button placements to be good and within reach even while using the smartphone single-handedly.\n\nThe side-mounted fingerprint scanner works well. It\u2019s fast and responsive and worked most of the time for us.\n\nOn the left, there\u2019s a triple-card slot. Two for SIM cards and a dedicated microSD card slot.\n\nRedmi Note 10 Pro Max comes with a 6.67-inch FHD+ AMOLED DotDisplay. It has a 120Hz refresh rate and it also supports HDR10.\n\nIn our perspective, it is among the best displays available in the price segment. Also, the addition of a 120Hz refresh rate and HDR10 is a brilliant move by the company. This is something that we do not often see in a smartphone of this price.\n\nThe display quality is good, it produces punchy and vibrant colours. Sunlight legibility and viewing angles are good too. Auto brightness of the smartphone is quick and responsive.\n\nRead More:\n\nOverall, the Redmi Note 10 Pro Max scores well in the design and display segment.\n\nXiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro Max: Performance\n\nXiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro Max packs some decent amount of punch within the modern-looking chassis. It is powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 732G processor.\n\nThe SD732G is a capable mid-range processor which packs a good level of performance in it. We tested the smartphone based on different usages conditions.\n\nRedmi Note 10 Pro Max was quick to set up including the data transfer from another Android smartphone. Also, it didn\u2019t take much time to bring us the home screen after completing the setup.\n\nNext, we started opening a couple of apps including Instagram, Facebook, Phone app, Skype, Chrome, etc. The smartphone handled everything without any lag or delay. In fact, the multitasking on the phone is good, thanks to 8GB of RAM.\n\nGaming performance is also acceptable. We played a couple of titles like COD Mobile, Free Fire, Subway surfer, Asphalt, Shadow Fight 3, etc. All the games managed to run at decent to good frame rates. Given it is a mid-range processor, there is some noticeable loading time. But it can be given a pass here. No big deal.\n\nComing to the operating system, it runs MIUI based on Android 11. Now, we have never been a fan of Xiaomi\u2019s user interface. It is clunky, feels unpolished at times, plus it comes with tons of bloatware.\n\nBut things are a little different and improved this time. The Android 11 based MIUI feels refined. The number of preloaded apps is also very less. But, ads are there and they are annoying.\n\nThe call quality is good and crisp. Our caller never complained about the call quality. Audio quality is also good and loud enough to fill up a medium-sized room.\n\nThe Redmi Note 10 Pro Max comes with a 5020mAh battery with support for 33W fast charging. The phone lasted for a day and a half before we reached out for the 33W fast charger. The charger though is fast enough and charges the smartphone in about 90 minutes.\n\nRead More:\n\nXiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro Max: Camera\n\nXiaomi has once again pushed the limit of putting a 108MP primary sensor in Note 10 Pro Max. But, as we have been saying that only megapixel count does not guarantee you the best image quality. The Redmi Note 10 Pro Max is the best example of that.\n\nA smartphone camera is a combination of software and hardware. Often good hardware is let down by average software. It requires a good camera processing unit and algorithm to bring out the true calibre of the sensor.\n\nApart from the 108MP primary sensor, there\u2019s a 5MP Super Macro sensor which also doubles up as the 2X telephoto, an 8MP ultra-wide sensor and a 2MP depth sensor.\n\nThe image quality from the primary sensor is acceptable, it appears to be a little on the softer side with missing details and sharpness. But this is when taking photos in the pixel-binning mode. Switching to a full 108MP resolution, things change dramatically. The dynamic range gets better, plenty of details noticed in the image. Also, contrast and saturation levels also got much better.\n\nThe low light shots have lots of noise and it is once again on the softer side. Switching to the dedicated night mode improves things but just by a margin. In the shot below, noise can be clearly seen. Also, the top corners on either side have some dark spots. We initially thought, there is some issue with the photo then we took multiple shots and each one of them has this dark spot.\n\nConsistency is another big issue with the camera. Sometimes, the colour appears to be good and near to natural. Sometimes it completely misses out. There\u2019s something weird going with the phone\u2019s colour science.\n\nThe other sensors, 8MP ultra-wide, 5MP 2X and Macro sensor also does a decent job and has an almost a similar story to tell.\n\nThe quality from the front camera sensor is acceptable and is good enough for taking selfies and making video calls.\n\nXiaomi has also added some cool features like Night Mode 2.0, Portrait mode, Dual video recording mode, Clone mode, Long exposure, etc. We test a couple of modes like Clone mode. It is a cool feature to have on a phone. Also, it does what it says.\n\nOverall, the Redmi Note 10 Pro Max is an average shooter even with a massive 108MP sensor.\n\nXiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro Max: Verdict\n\nXiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro Max is the first smartphone to bring a 108MP camera at an affordable price segment. For the asking price of Rs 18,999, the Redmi Note 10 Pro Max has a lot to offer. It comes with features that are nowhere to be found in this price segment, but at the same time, it has to cut some corners as well. Opting for a physical fingerprint scanner is one of them.\n\nThe Redmi Note 10 Pro Max is not a bad phone, it is actually a pretty good phone with an AMOLED display, 120Hz refresh rate, bigger battery, solid build quality. We just wish that the camera should have shown a little more potential.\n\nBut, should you buy it and is it any better than the competition?\n\nis practically the only competition available for Redmi Note 10 Pro in the market which offers a 108MP sensor in the segment. It is around Rs 1,000 cheaper than this Xiaomi handset. But, for that extra 1000 bucks, Redmi Note 10 Pro Max has a lot to offer. Features like 120Hz refresh rate, bigger display, dual speakers, etc. So, if you are looking for a mid-range phone that offers a mix of everything, then you should consider the Redmi Note 10 Pro Max.\n\nXiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro Max Display 6.67 inches (16.9 cm) Performance Qualcomm Snapdragon 732G Ram 6 GB Storage 64 GB Battery 5020 mAh Price in india 18999 see full specifications \u276f\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin",

        "text": "critic rating 4\n\nTop Features Vibrant display Smooth performance Premium design\n\nSomeone rightly said that \u201cidentities are like teeth: hard to maintain and easy to lose, but people tend to look at you funny when you were missing one.\u201d Now not that OnePlus has lost its identity but it certainly has deviated from what it started off. From the promise of being a flagship killer to having aspirations about making killer flagships -- OnePlus has managed to change its identity but not giving up completely. An example of this is the newly launched\n\n.\n\nWith this year\u2019s smartphones, OnePlus has taken its handsets to a new price point \u2014 hitting a Rs 70,000 mark for its most powerful device of 2021.\n\nExcept that the\n\n-- an India-only device -- still promises to live up to OnePlus\u2019 billing of making affordable flagships that can stand tall alongside the premium ones. But does the OnePlus 9R offer that? We find out in our review:\n\nDesign\n\n\n\nOnePlus has always been good when it comes to the design of its smartphones. In a world full of bizarre-looking phones with weird combinations of gradient back designs, OnePlus has always managed to offer subtle yet premium looking handsets and Oneplus 9R is no different.\n\nThe OnePus 9R can be purchased in two \u2018sophisticated\u2019 colour options of Lake Blue and Carbon Black. If you are someone who likes their smartphones to look funky then these may disappoint you. However, if you like your devices to appear subtle then you will like them just fine.\n\nWe got our hands on the Lake Blue colour option of the OnePlus 9R and were quite pleased with how it looked. It sports a glossy back that is curved on both sides with only the OnePlus logo placed in the centre. It is a glass back but doesn\u2019t attract too many fingerprints making you clean every hour. The camera sensors are placed on the top left corner.\n\nOnePlus 9R comes in an aluminium frame that houses the power button and alert slider on the left edge, volume rocker keys on the right and speaker grille, dual SIM slot and USB-C port on the bottom. No issues with the placement or the functionalities of these buttons and ports.\n\nOverall, the OnePlus 9R is a quintessential device you expect from the brand. We found it to be slightly slippery so our advice would be to use a cover to avoid damages. It weighs 189g and is 8.4mm thick which shouldn\u2019t be a problem if you are used to big devices.\n\nDisplay\n\n\n\nThe OnePlus 9R comes with a screen that is exactly the same as the\n\nas well as the\n\n. You get a flat 6.55-inch Fluid AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and HDR10+ support.\n\nThanks to the refresh rate, you get a snappy and responsive display experience. The overall colour reproduction is good and you also get appropriate contrast levels too.\n\nUnder the display settings, you get a dedicated \u2018Vibrant Colour Effect\u2019 that is said to optimise video colours and contrast to make it look more vivid. Further, you can also adjust the colour temperature of the display as well as the refresh rate.\n\nThe OnePlus 9R also offers an in-display fingerprint sensor, which is placed at a comfortable spot. You get a punch-hole camera for the selfie sensor.\n\nPerformance\n\n\n\nThe OnePlus 9R comes powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 870 SoC, which as per the chipmaker is more powerful than the last year\u2019s flagship processor Snapdragon 865+ and is placed right below this year\u2019s most powerful processor \u2014 the Snapdragon 888. In simple terms, you do get an extremely powerful chipset at your disposal that should take care of heavy-duty stuff.\n\nIn terms of storage, the OnePlus 9R comes in 8GB RAM and 128GB ROM model and 12GB RAM and 256GB ROM model. Both models are UFS 3.1 storage further satisfying the quench for speed. You do not get microSD card support, however, these internal storage options should be enough for regular needs.\n\nWe had no complaints in the day-to-day functioning of the handset and faced no issues of lagging or frame freezing with the OnePlus 9R. The handset acts on your commands snappily, whether it is opening apps, switching between them, browsing the internet for hours with various apps running in the background. The stereo speakers deliver a respectable audio experience that is not only loud enough but also crisp.\n\nThe OnePlus 9R runs on the Android 11 operating system with OxygenOS 11.2 UI custom layer. The OxygenOS is one of the likeable custom OS that you can find as it comes with no bloatware or spam notifications.\n\nYou get to customise the theme, text colour, icon shapes and font on the device. You also get Digital Wellbeing and something called \u2018Work-Life Balance\u2019 that lets you prioritise notifications for different time periods of the day. For instance, you can select your work hours and days during which you will get notifications only from specific apps during that time period.\n\nFor gaming enthusiasts, the OnePlus 9R boasts of 40 Hz touch sampling rate allows users to simultaneously use up to five fingers and an X-axis linear motor, which can be tuned to produce dynamic vibration that can simulate different styles of in-game vibrations.\n\nOnePlus also claims that the handset comes with multi-layer cooling system and has 14 temperature sensors that are constantly monitoring the temperature of the device.\n\nIt also comes with a dedicated Pro Gaming Mode that is said to restricts background apps, block calls and notifications to make the gameplay smooth.\n\nRead More:\n\nCamera\n\nOnePlus 9R is slightly less competent than its other OnePlus 9 siblings and in fact, offers the same camera specs as the OnePlus 8T model from last year.\n\nStarting with the selfie camera first, you get a 16MP sensor that manages to capture detailed but soft images, despite turning off the beauty mode.\n\nOn the back, there is a quad-camera setup that includes a 48MP Sony IMX586 primary camera with 6P lens glass, OIS, EIS and f/1.7 aperture. This comes with a 16MP ultrawide camera with f/2.2 aperture and 123-degree field of view, a 5MP macro lens and a 2MP monochrome lens.\n\nThe camera app on the OnePlus 9R lets you easily switch between a wide-angle (0.6x) lens, the primary lens (1x), and the optical zoom (2x) lens by a toggle that is right on the main screen. In order to click the images in the 48MP mode, you have to tap on the three-dot icon on the top right corner and then select 48MP. If this is not done, images in default are clicked in 12MP mode.\n\n(ultra-wide camera)\n\n(main sensor)\n\n(2x zoom)\n\nAs far as the image quality is concerned, you do not get the Hasselblad-infused dedicated features, but an overall well-balanced output.\n\n(outdoor shot \u2014 bokeh mode)\n\n\n\nStarting with the daylight shots, almost all shots that are clicked turn out to be vivid and bright \u2014 with just the right amount of colour reproduction. You witness slight distortion with the ultrawide angle sensor but nothing glaring. The zoomed-in shots are also well detailed.\n\nObjects captured in an indoor lighting setup were not exceptionally impressive as we found them to be slightly dull.\n\n(indoor lighting)\n\n\n\nMoving on to the low-light shots, the primary lens will do its job well enough for you to not complain about the overall dynamic range. The Nightscape mode obviously plays a role in that. However, the ultrawide angle camera is certainly not at par with the primary camera even with the Nightscape mode.\n\n(Nightscape mode)\n\n\n\n(Nightscape mode)\n\n(Nightscape mode \u2014 ultrawide angle camera)\n\n\n\nThe monochrome sensor that captures black and white images can be enabled through a filter, which does the job. Lastly, the macro sensor is a bit tricky as it may take a couple of shots and a bit of patience to capture what you are aiming for.\n\n(monochrome sensor)\n\n\n\n(macro sensor)\n\n\n\nBattery\n\nOnePlus 9R houses a 4500mAh battery that is complemented with a 65W fast charger. However, you get an old design of the charger with a Type-A port rather than the Type-C one that you get with other OnePlus 9 models.\n\nDepending on the usage that varies from moderate to heavy, you should be able to get a full day\u2019s usage or longer without running for the charger every few hours. Fast charge support also covers quick charging needs.\n\nRead More:\n\n\n\nVerdict\n\n\n\nUnless you want the top-of-the-line specs and features and want a OnePlus phone only then this isn\u2019t a phone for you. But if you want a good-looking phone that checks all the essential boxes and there\u2019s a lot to like about it. A snappy display that complements the design and performance that won\u2019t let you down. Add in a camera that is more than competent enough along with a powerful battery -- it\u2019s almost a complete package at this price.\n\nWhy almost? Because you do miss out on features that are now the \u201cpremium\u201d in the OnePlus space \u2014 such as IP rating or wireless charging \u2014 found in the OnePlus 9 and\n\n.\n\nThe device is more or less the same as the OnePlus 8T in terms of specs, which is Rs 1,000 less expensive than the OnePlus 9R right now. You should consider the OnePlus 9R if you are looking for a well-balanced device within this price segment. Competition won\u2019t make OnePlus\u2019 life easy though as the Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro (Rs 37,999 onwards) and the recently launched Vivo X60 (Rs 37,990 onwards) are formidable offerings. Having said that, the OnePlus 9R remains true to OnePlus\u2019 \u2018original\u2019 promise and that\u2019s something the brand always stood firm on.\n\nOneplus 9r 5G Display 6.55 inches (16.63 cm) Performance Qualcomm Snapdragon 870 Ram 8 GB Storage 128 GB Battery 4500 mAh Price in india 39999 see full specifications \u276f\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin",

        "title": "Asus TUF Dash F15 review: Asus TUF Dash F15 review: Lives up to the expectations",
        "text": "critic rating 4\n\nTop Features Solid build quality Optimal performance Decent battery life\n\nAsus has been making gaming machines for quite some time now under its ROG lineup. It\u2019s not very recently until Asus announced its TUF series gaming laptop to cater much wider audience with its plain, simple yet elegant look and\n\nto serve almost all types of gaming needs.\n\nThe TUF Dash F15 is the latest addition to the portfolio. The latest gaming laptop brings a compact and slim form factor without missing on performance quotient at least on paper.\n\nThe laptop packs interesting internals such as 11th-generation Intel Core processors, RTX 30 series graphics, fast RAM and storage and a display that\u2019s more suitable for both gamers as well as content creators.\n\nWhile modern Asus high-performance laptops are designed for gamers, lately Asus has also started planting their machines for creators as well by offering colour accurate displays, better thermals and also a good set of keyboard and trackpad.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to talk about the TUF Dash F15 which we are going to do in this review of the laptop. Read on.\n\nAsus TUF Dash F15: Design and display\n\nThe TUF Dash F15 carries the company's new design philosophy of \u2018keeping it slim and sophisticated\u2019 without being so loud on the gaming front. The new chassis design feels more refined and well built. It is a solid laptop with minimum to zero body flex at all even right at the centre of the keyboard deck and display flap.\n\nOur review unit was grey in colour but the company also makes a Moonlight White colour variant of the laptop. The grey colour looks good and the minimal TUF logo at the top gives it a simple look and feel.\n\nWhile the top is done in grey, the inside is done in black and is all-plastic. It\u2019s good quality plastic and gives a soft touch feel without feeling cheap by any means.\n\nThe keyboard layout is similar to what we have seen with most Asus laptops. However, the transparent WASD keys look fancy and cool. However, it has a drawback too. We noticed that when the backlit of the laptop is turned on, other keys are well lit, however, the WASD keys demand more brightness and feel poorly lit all the time. Also, the laptop gets only one backlit colour which is somewhere between the greenish, blueish tint.\n\nOn the other hand, the keyboard is good, has an ample amount of key travel and offers good feedback when pressed.\n\nTalking about the trackpad, it is placed in the exact centre of the laptop, which according to us is a weird position. However, the trackpad is responsive and supports Windows Precision Drivers and gestures.\n\nPort selection is also pretty decent. It comes with 1x 3.5mm combo audio jack, 1x HDMI 2.0b, 3x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, 1x RJ45 LAN port, 1x Type C USB 4 support DisplayPort / power delivery / Thunderbolt 4 ports.\n\nAnother important thing to mention is the lack of a webcam on the laptop. Now, this might be a good thing for privacy cautious people, but for a gaming laptop, a good webcam should have been a welcome addition.\n\nThe TUF Dash F15 features a 15.6-inch FHD+ display with 1920 x 1080p resolution. Also, to cater to gaming needs, Asus has used a really fast 240Hz refresh rate with support for Adaptive Sync.\n\nIn our test, the display produced vibrant colours, with decent black levels and saturation. Also, the 240Hz really helps with the overall smooth gaming performance.\n\nAsus TUF Dash F15: Performance\n\nThe TUF Dash F15 comes with two configurations. Both the models come with an 11th-generation Intel Core i7-11370H processor with a base clock speed of 3.3 GHz, and a boost clock of 4.8GHz. It is then paired with either Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 graphics, the model we are reviewing and RTX 3060.\n\nIt's quite a capable configuration and we have to admit that it reflects in its performance. Let\u2019s get to testing.\n\nThe daily driver test\n\nA daily driver test includes a couple of applications, browsing, watching movies, videos, etc. In our test, the laptop handled everything with ease. There was no lag or delay while moving through apps or basic software like word processors, browsers, etc. Also, we pushed the limit by opening around 20 tabs at a time on\n\n. No issues at all.\n\nThe content creator test\n\nWhile the TUF Dash F15 passed the first test without any worries, we decided to take thing further with the content creator test. This test pushes the system limits to an extent and includes photo editing on Photoshop and editing videos.\n\nWhile we started editing a random high-resolution photo clicked using a 108MP smartphone and added multiple layers of effects and rendered it. The fan did click a bit earlier than expected, but it kept the temperature in check and also rendered the image quite efficiently. The video editing test includes a 2 minute 4K footage with multiple layers of transitions, sound effects, motion graphics, etc and there the laptop stumbled once, but that was also the last in our test. Its export speed was fast and it also rendered most details fine.\n\nThe gaming test\n\nAt last, the most important test because most people will be looking forward to this laptop for gaming. We ran a couple of heavy and demanding games on this laptop. Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War, Hitman 3 and Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nAll three of them are among the latest games and support ray tracing as well. The laptop managed to run them at a decent frame rate. However, we noticed it had some issues with the Cyberpunk 2077 at the maximum possible settings. This is understandable as Cyberpunk 2077 is a demanding game by nature and to run it on max graphics settings can make a powerhouse bend its knees.\n\nOverall, the laptop managed to perform really well in all the tests proving its calibre to be among the most powerful machines in its price range.\n\nThe speakers are on the laptop are average and do not sound as good as expected from a gaming machine. We will recommend using good headphones while gaming.\n\nAsus TUF Dash F15: Battery\n\nThe laptop comes with a four-cell 76Wh battery with 200W power brick. The battery life of the laptop without the 240Hz refresh rate is good and it managed to last for around 6 to 7 hours under the daily driver test. Heavy gaming on this won\u2019t last longer than 1.5 hours which is decent.\n\nAsus TUF Dash F15: Verdict\n\nAsus has always been very aggressive when it comes to pricing its TUF series laptops. This one is no different. The base variant with RTX 3060 graphics costs Rs 1,39,990, while the top model with RTX 3070 graphics is just Rs 1,000 more than the base.\n\nNow, this is not a cheap laptop by any means, however, for the specifications and performance it offers, this isn\u2019t too much to ask.\n\nIn our view, the TUF Dash F15 is a capable machine not only in terms of gaming but also for content creators. The laptop could have been a good option for daily usages as well. But, the missing webcam takes that tag away.\n\nFor other stuff, it has got solid performance, good build quality, impressive display and acceptable battery life.\n\nSo, should you buy it, shortlist it or look for other options available? There\u2019s a lot going for this laptop and we can recommend it without too much hesitation as you won\u2019t be disappointed with its overall performance\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin",

        "title": "noise buds play review: Noise Buds Play review: Skips a beat or two",
        "text": "critic rating 2.5\n\nTop Features Good fit Fast pairing Mostly balanced sound\n\nThe\n\nmarket in India has been slowly evolving in the past two years, with brands trying to outdo rivals by working on compact wireless listening devices and trying to keep them affordable. Of late there have been TWS earbuds launched by OnePlus and Realme in the Indian market, priced below Rs 3k. That has upped the expectations from other audio brands to release good quality products that are affordable too. Domestic smart wearables brand Noise recently launched the Buds Play\n\nearbuds in India at a price point of Rs 7,999. This is a product designed and made in India. Our review unit was the Celeste Blue colour variant of the earbuds. Here is what we think of the product.\n\nPlay: Design\n\nThe Buds Play TWS earbuds come in a medium, pebble-shaped charging case with a lightweight lid to close it. There is a USB Type-C charging port at the bottom of the case and a circular reset button at its back.\n\nEach earbud weighs about 4.4gm and comes equipped with a 10mm driver. The design is quite similar to the earbuds from some other brands, with a long stem. There are two orifices for microphones on each of the earbuds, thus a total of four of them.\n\nBoth the earbuds feel light in the ears even after wearing them for more than two hours and there is no ear strain of any kind provided you have fit them with ear tips of the right size. Noise provides ear tips of three different sizes for the right fit inside the package. The sizes are small, medium and large. A USB Type-C charging cable comes bundled with the package.\n\nThe company claims that once the charging case gets fully charged, you could charge the TWS earbuds up to 4 times. When you open the lid, the earbuds will power on and will be ready for pairing. They power off when you close the lid.\n\n\n\nNoise Buds Play: Performance\n\nConnecting the Buds Play to the phone was fast and hassle-free. First keep both the earbuds inside the charging case and do not close down the lid. A green light will start blinking. Now, turn on the Bluetooth of your phone to pair the device. It takes just about 2-3 seconds for the phone to recognise the earbuds. The Buds Play got paired with the laptop also with that ease. The Bluetooth connectivity remains strong for about 8-9 metres.\n\nThere was a slight \u201ckrrrrr\u201d sound coming off from the right earbud even when nothing was being played. Whenever we played a track, the sound vanished. We reset the device twice, thinking it might solve the issue, but it didn\u2019t. Playing anything on the earbuds just overshadows the slight disturbance; it does not go away. Maybe it just happened with our review unit and the other units are doing alright. At least this is what we experienced.\n\nThe sound output for files of 320kbps and above bitrate is mostly balanced, with the bass, mids and treble syncing well with the playback. It is not very loud though; you would have to jack up the volume levels beyond 70% for a good output. Initially, we felt the earbuds lacked in the reproduction of mids but they were actually able to do so after playing some songs. The Buds Play handle Electronic soundtracks well but fall short of doing justice to Rock, Instrumental and Metal music. Overall, the bass output feels a bit low too. The rich, enveloping sound production of the guitar riffs in Classic Rock and Metal tracks feels missing; the mids are alright but the sound comes off a bit flaky. Sure, you could up the volume, but we missed the feel of the rugged strum of the strings on the eardrums.\n\nIf you prefer listening to music through your laptop, relying on high-bitrate music files, the Buds Play sound far better than they do with a smartphone. With a laptop, the sound comes off richer and with a lot of punch, wherever the song needs. Some of the tracks that we played on the true wireless earbuds were Pushing Me Away by Linkin Park, Let Me Go by Avril Lavigne (ft. Chad Kroeger), F.N.T. by Semisonic and Monster by Skillet.\n\nWith audio streaming services, the playback kept on breaking off and resuming, taking a pause of about half a second. This happened with every track that we played, multiple times during the songs. Even after resetting the device. Sometimes, the playback even paused by itself. The worst part came when taking a call; the slight \u201ckrrrr\u201d became something else entirely. Imagine a humanoid with a robotic voice that\u2019s developed some defect, trying to convey vocally along with the person on the other side. That bad. Again, we would like to reiterate that this could be an issue with our particular unit and others may not face it.\n\nThe earbuds could go on easily for about a week or more on one charge if you listen to about 35-40 minutes daily.\n\nVerdict\n\nFor Rs 7,999, the build of the Buds Play TWS earbuds is premium, the earbuds are lightweight and fit comfortably. The sound quality is overall balanced, but only with high-bit rate songs. If your playlist is made up of high bitrate Electronic songs or you use a streaming service, the Buds Play could impress you with their balanced sound output. The Bluetooth also holds up well in the range of 8-9 metres and does not break off intermittently. The battery life can be considered long if you listen to about 40-45 minutes every day.\n\nThe rest is not much to write home about. The Buds Play kept on making this tiny disturbance with one earbud even after resetting them, the songs kept pausing repeatedly and resuming after that half-a-second break when using streaming services and the call quality was abysmal.\n\nAll that being said, Noise still has shown some promise with the Buds Play. But it needs to up its technology implementation game with the audio if it wants to make the right kind of noise in the market.\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin",

        "title": "Redmi TV X55 review: Affordable price, impressive display",
        "text": "critic rating 3.5\n\nTop Features Impressive display Decent audio quality Good design\n\nRedmi was declared an independent brand in 2019. This sub-brand of China-based Xiaomi is all about value-for-money products, while the Mi brand offers premium devices with aggressive pricing. Other than smartphones, Redmi has already ventured into product categories like wireless earbuds, power banks and smart bands. The company has now entered the smart TV market in India with the launch of its first smart TV. Called the Redmi TV X series, the line-up consists of three screen sizes: 50-inch, 55-inch and 65-inch.\n\nWe reviewed the 55-inch model of Redmi TV X which comes with a price tag of Rs 38,999. Here\u2019s our review\n\nRedmi TV X 55: Design\n\nis a rather standard looking TV set. It has a comparatively thin profile on the side and features a plastic body. What catches one\u2019s eye as soon as one takes the TV out of the packaging box is the Redmi branding on the rear side. It is so prominent that you can not miss it.\n\nThe 55-inch screen model that we received is a slightly bigger unit. It could be big for some rooms. But that depends on a case to case basis. The TV comes with a plastic stand out-of-the-box to place it on a table or something. Users can choose to mount it on a wall. But, they will have to spend extra bucks to buy the wall mount stand.\n\nHaving said that the smart TV blends well with the background, thanks to the thin frame. As we said before, the device has a plastic body with black borders around it. There is an indicator light at the front-bottom, behind which is the power button. Redmi branding can be seen right above the indicator light.\n\nFor connectivity, the smart TV features a unique L-shaped pattern. The 3 HDMI ports, 2 USB ports and a 3.5mm audio output port are placed on the left side. While the Antenna, AV input sockets, Optical audio output and Ethernet port are placed on the bottom panel facing downwards. This specific pattern of placing the ports comes in handy, especially when the TV is mounted on a wall and there is less room for movement.\n\nRedmi TV X 55: Display\n\n\n\nThe display is one of the biggest highlights of the Redmi smart TV. The smart TV has a 4K LED panel which comes with support for all HDR formats. These include HDR 10, HDR 10+ and Hybrid Log Gamma. The TV comes with over 85% of the NTSC colour space and 92% DCI-P3 colour gamut.\n\nThe picture quality is really good. Colours are not oversaturated and are aptly balanced with the right amount of contrast and sharpness.\n\nThe TV\u2019s display also offers Dolby Vision support which enhances the viewing experience on the TV. having Dolby Vision support at this price point is a bid add-on. Watching high-quality content is top-notch on the Redmi TV X55. Be it Natasha Lyonne\u2019s Russian Doll on Netflix (Dolby Vision) or The Family Man on Amazon Prime Video (4K UHD HDR), the TV offers an impressive view.\n\nRedmi smart TV is also equipped with features like Reality Flow and Vivid Picture Engine. The Reality Flow offers a fluid display with intelligent frame insertion to offer blur-free visuals on the TV. The Vivid Picture Engine helps set accurate levels of contrasts, colours, brightness and clarity. These features help improve the overall picture quality on the TV\u2019s screen and are always welcomed.\n\nRedmi TV X 55: Performance\n\nRedmi TV X55 is powered by a 64-bit Mediatek quad-core processor and runs on Android 10 operating system. With this, the TV packs 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. Like other Xiaomi smart TVs, this TV too features Patchwall OS from Xiaomi.\n\nThe TV\u2019s interface is quick to understand and get used to it. Given this was the first time I used a Xiaomi TV, I was able to navigate through it easily. Thanks to the Patchwall UI, the smart TV comes preloaded with multiple OTT apps. But in case one wants to download more apps, there is 16GB of storage space offered on the device. We liked the Smart Recommendation feature of the Patchwall. It suggests curated content with features like India\u2019 Top ten, collections and more.\n\nThere is also a User Centre feature that creates a customised viewing space for a user as per one\u2019s likes and dislikes. This comes very handy, especially when you are really not sure what to stream.\n\nThere is also a Kids mode that offers some interesting parental control features. With the safe universal search, parents can restrict age inappropriate content on the TV. Then there is Parental Lock to watch content designed for kids. All these tools will be useful for the parents out there to block out unnecessary/inappropriate content for their kids.\n\nAnother feature worth mentioning is the Mi Home app which can be downloaded and used via the Patchwall launcher. The app, once connected to the TV can be used to control Xiaomi\u2019s smart devices like smart bulb, smart speaker and more.\n\nThen, the TV comes with Google Chromecast built-in feature to project a smartphone screen on the TV. For sound output, the smart TV features two 15 watt speakers, thus rendering a sound output of 30 watts. The audio quality is fine-tuned by DTX Virtual X technology. The output is loud with clear sound quality. Volume levels are adequate. The dialogues and lyrics were clear enough too.\n\nOther than the connectivity ports, the TV can also be connected to Bluetooth devices. We paired it with a Bluetooth earphone with the TV and did not face any problem.\n\nHowever, the TV does give some hiccups in terms of overall performance. While there was no freezing of the screen, there was a noticeable lag while switching between apps. Also, at times, the TV disconnected from the Wi-Fi at home without any possible reason. I had to re-enter the password to get things back to normal.\n\nRedmi TV X 55: Remote\n\nRedmi TV X 55 smart TV comes with a remote with minimal buttons. The TV remote has dedicated buttons for popular OTT apps. There is also a Google Assistant button on the remote to trigger the digital voice assistant instantly. The feature can be helpful in launching media directly and quickly, thus skipping a few buttons press.\n\nVerdict\n\nSo, what makes Redmi TV X55 a good buy? We will have to give it to the display which comes with HDR 10+ and Dolby Vision support and the audio quality. Though there are some minor hiccups here and there, overall it's a good device. This considering the price range of the smart TV. Redmi TV X55 is priced at Rs 38,999 and offers many features that may be lacking in many of its competitors.\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin",

        "title": "Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G review: All things nice",
        "text": "critic rating 4\n\nTop Features Elegant design Bright display Smooth performance\n\nThe trend of making affordable premium phones has caught up quite rapidly in the Indian smartphone market. Premium flagship phone makers like\n\n, Apple, OnePlus all have affordable offerings in the space, which is slowly getting a bit crowded. The latest player in the market is\n\n. Now that the Galaxy S21 series has been around for a couple months, it\u2019s bit peculiar to see the last generation\u2019s affordable option in the market. Curiously, Samsung had launched the S20 FE in October 2020 but the newer variant is more \u2018future-proof\u2019 with 5G capabilities in tow. What new does the Galaxy S20 FE 5G bring apart from the 5G tag? Read our review to find out more\n\n: Design and display\n\nNothing much has changed in terms of design compared to the Galaxy S20 series. Samsung has given a matte finish to the polycarbonate body and added a metallic frame to it. Despite no glass back, this is a premium looking phone. What the polycarbonate panel does is that it makes it free from smudges or any kind of fingerprints \u2014 a big plus in our books. No glass back also means that you can use this phone without any cover. And it\u2019s something that you should do as it is a phone worthy of flaunting. The review unit we got was in Cloud Mint colour and is delightful to look at. It\u2019s pleasing to the eye and catches the attention without being too much in your face. It\u2019s refreshing to see brands like Samsung not opting for the gradient back design \u2014 a design trend that should be confined to the recycle bin of history books for once and all \u2014 and go for a more subtle and elegant look.\n\nThis is a solid and well-built phone and fits easily in your hand as well. Samsung hasn\u2019t given a headphone jack whereas the button placement is at its usual spots. The smartphone also comes with an IP68 rating which protects it from dust and water. Not many phones in this price ranger offer the feature, so kudos to Samsung for providing it.\n\nSamsung has always been a step ahead in terms of display and the Galaxy S20 FE 5G is no different. The 6.5-inch flat screen has an AMOLED display panel which produces vibrant colours, sharp viewing angles and great brightness levels. The screen is big \u2014 and good enough \u2014 for you to binge-watch content on it. The display also supports 120Hz refresh rate which makes it really smooth to operate. Unlike some other phones, you won\u2019t find a dynamic 120Hz display feature in the Galaxy S20 FE 5G. The adaptive brightness feature works like a charm on the smartphone. The display is certainly one of the biggest plus points of this smartphone.\n\nRead More:\n\nSamsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G review: Performance\n\nSamsung has always \u2014 or rather mostly \u2014 opted for an Exynos processor for most of its smartphones across price range. This is one where area where the S20 FE 5G stands out from the \u2018crowd\u2019. It gets a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor rather than Samsung\u2019s own Exynos. It\u2019s not the top of the line processor \u2014 that will be the Snapdragon 888 \u2014 found in Android phones but it\u2019s nothing to scoff at.\n\nThe Snapdragon 865 is a really good processor and it\u2019s evident in the day-to-day performance of the Galaxy S20 Fe 5G. Be it browsing content, usual social media activities, editing images \u2014 the S20 Fe 5G handles it all with aplomb. Multitasking is a breeze and so is almost every other activity you could do with a smartphone.\n\nGaming is also quite a good experience on the smartphone. Titles like Call of Duty: Mobile played at max graphics setting work without any stutter or lag. Samsung has given dual firing speakers which are really good for gaming as well as multimedia content consumption. Even after 45 minutes of gaming sessions, we couldn\u2019t see any sort of heating or lagging issues with the smartphone.\n\nThe Galaxy S20 FE 5G runs Android 11 topped with Samsung\u2019s own OneUI 3.0. Compared to all other custom UI \u2014 barring OnePlus\u2019s OxygenOS \u2014 Samsung\u2019s OneUI is far better in terms of user interface and features. There are features like Edge Panels, Easy mode, Dual Messenger which give users a plethora of options to customise the phone and make the user experience pleasant. Not that it ships without any bloatware. There are a lot of Samsung apps which frankly you will not need unless Samsung is your go to brand for all gadgets \u2014 wireless buds, smartwatch among others. Same goes for the Microsoft apps. If you aren\u2019t into Microsoft\u2019s ecosystem then these apps also count for bloatware only in our books. Mercifully, you can uninstall most of these apps and get some extra storage space in exchange.\n\nWith the Snapdragon 865 processor in tow, the Galaxy S20 FE 5G can take on almost every smartphone in this price and stand its ground easily.\n\nRead More:\n\nSamsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G review: Camera\n\nYou will find a triple camera setup at the back which includes a 12MP primary camera, a 12MP ultra-wide camera and an 8MP telephoto camera. Samsung hasn\u2019t opted for attention grabbing 48 or 64 or even 108 MP sensors \u2014 instead it has gone for a tried and tested model that rarely disappoints.\n\nThe images we clicked with all three sensors during day light are full of details, lots of sharpness and enough dynamic range. The colour reproduction is accurate and Samsung has worked hard on reducing the artificialness from its camera samples \u2014 something that is evident in the last few flagship phones as well.\n\nThe Portrait mode is a good example of that as most images look natural with the right amount of blurs. The edge detection is accurate in most photos but can be amiss at times. Samsung gives enough features in the camera app to rectify any misses that might occur in clicking a photos.\n\nThe wide-angle camera clicks reasonably good images and most people won\u2019t have any complaints with it. The Night mode has to be manually toggled and is needed for low-light photography. Without it, the images do have a fair bit of noise in low-light conditions.\n\nSamsung has given a 32MP sensor at the front for the selfie brigade and they won\u2019t be disappointed. The front camera works really well and clicks some nice images with a lot of details and accuracy.\n\nRead More:\n\nSamsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G review: Battery\n\nYou are bound to get a full-day\u2019s battery with more than usual usage which could include attending calls, watching videos, social media and other stuff. If you end up binge-watching and gaming for longer durations, then you will have to charge the phone by evening time for sure. The smartphone does support wireless charging and also has the Wireless Power Sharing feature that allows you to charge other smartphones.\n\nSamsung is not giving a fast charger with the\n\nas you get a 15W charger. It\u2019s a bit of surprise as competition certainly gives 30W or in some cases even a 65W charger. The 15W charger means that you will take at least 100 minutes to fully charge the device.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G review: Verdict\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G is a smartphone that will end up pleasing most people. The phone has a lot going for it \u2014 reliable performance, bright and vibrant display and good camera performance. It faces competition from the\n\nseries but is capable enough to stand its ground. At Rs 47,999, if you want a premium looking phone that delivers impressive day-to-day performance then the S20 FE 5G is a really good option to look at.\n\nOneplus 9 Display 6.55 inches (16.63 cm) Performance Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 Ram 8 GB Storage 128 GB Battery 4500 mAh Price in india 49999 see full specifications \u276f\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin",

        "title": "Acer TravelMate P214-53 review: Productivity on-the-go",
        "text": "critic rating 3.5\n\nTop Features -Decent display -Smooth performer -Ample connectivity ports\n\n\u2019s TravelMate series of laptops are meant for people who need a solid device to work while they are travelling -- which is something the brand has made evident in the nomenclature. Acer has recently added new models to its TravelMate series of productivity-focused laptops. While the looks of TravelMate series laptops are similar to most other Acer laptops, the company has refreshed the TravelMate P models with 11th-gen Intel Core processors, more RAM and storage. Acer has pitched the new TravelMate P-series Windows laptops as a no-nonsense workhorse with a tough body.\n\nWe used the TravelMate P214-53 model with Windows 10 Pro operating system, priced at Rs 65,000, for a while. Here\u2019s our review.\n\nAcer TravelMate P214-53: Design and display\n\nThe device comes in an all-black finish with a tough plastic body. The build quality instils confidence and Acer claims it to be \u2018military standard\u2019 tested for durability. Having said that this laptop will win no accolades for its design or looks. It's a plain device made for people who need to work on the go.\n\nWhile the device feels sturdy, the quality of the plastic used is quite dull and gives no premium feel at all. The quality of the keypad and touchpad is decent and there\u2019s nothing to complain about. The broad black bezels around the display are an eyesore. Acer has included a privacy shutter on the webcam along with a fingerprint scanner integrated into the touchpad itself.\n\nLike with all Acer laptops, you will need to spend some time with the device to get used to keyboard and trackpad alignment, as it\u2019s slightly small and placed leftwards. Thankfully, you get a backlit chiclet keyboard.\n\nComing to display, there\u2019s a 14-inch full HD resolution LED-backlit LCD panel with a matte finish which prevents glares and reflections. The display quality is satisfactory with good viewing angles. But it\u2019s not the best display for your entertainment needs and there\u2019s no touch support. This device is mostly about all work and no play. For conferencing, there\u2019s an HD webcam that produces decent video quality.\n\nAcer TravelMate P214-53: Performance\n\nThe Acer TravelMate P214-53 runs on an 11th-gen Intel core i5-1135G7 processor with 16GB of RAM, 1TB storage space, Intel UHD graphics and lots of connectivity ports. Talking about performance, the 11th-gen Intel core i5-1135G7 processor with 16GB of RAM can easily take on corporate workloads. It's a smooth performer overall and you may be even tempted to try out some games after seeing the hardware capabilities.\n\nWhen it comes to audio output, you would need speakers or headphones for calls and entertainment. The audio quality is not something to boast of and Acer needs to work on it.\n\nAcer is pitching the TravelMate P series as an affordable travel-friendly laptop for office work. Truth be told, this laptop is not the lightest and weighs around 1.7kg without the charging cable and adapter. Thankfully, there\u2019s a USB Type-C port for charging and you connect the laptop to any 30W adapter of any mobile phone to charge the device in case you decide to leave the charger at home. As far as battery life is concerned, you may get a mixed usage time of around 6 hours under medium brightness from the 3-cell Li-Ion battery.\n\nAcer has offered lots of connectivity ports. You get three standard USB 3.1 ports, one Type-C, HDMI, SD card slot, VGA, LAN and audio combo jack.\n\nFor the price of Rs 65,000, the Acer TravelMate P214-53 is offering a lot of value for the money you are spending. It\u2019s a workhorse for daily production needs. It doesn\u2019t have any fancy features to flaunt or the looks but it delivers reliable performance.\n\n: Verdict\n\nThe Acer TravelMate P214-53 is an ideal choice if you want a reliable laptop with capable hardware. This machine bets big on practically and suits well for someone who needs to be utmost productive while travelling. With ample connectivity ports, smooth performance and decent display to work on, this Acer laptop offers good value for money when compared to other devices offering an 11th-gen Intel core i5-1135G7 processor.\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin",

        "title": "OnePlus Watch review: Bold first attempt",
        "text": "critic rating 3.5\n\nTop Features -Sturdy design -Good battery life and fast charging -Good display\n\nThe first smartwatch from\n\nhas arrived. After years of hype, the\n\nfinally joins the affordable smartwatch race following Xiaomi, Realme, Oppo and others. Only that the OnePlus Watch can not be called affordable at a price of Rs 14,999, considering the Indian market.\n\nOnePlus has managed to make a good-looking watch with key focus on display quality, connectivity, battery life and fast charging. But the decision to opt for its own software to sync the watch with a lesser-known OnePlus Health mobile app may need to be reconsidered. Going beyond the looks, software is the key for any wearable to shine. And making good software takes time. After using the\n\nfor some time here\u2019s our review.\n\nWATCH VIDEO: OnePlus Watch quick look\n\nOnePlus Watch: Design and display\n\nThe OnePlus Watch features a stainless steel case and measures 46mm in size. This watch feels heavy but not bulky. Also, the steel case makes the watch appear premium and sturdy. On the right side, there are two buttons to help you navigate through the interface. The finishing is quite good with no sharp edges or unnecessary protrusions.\n\nIn India, you will only have the option to choose between Midnight Black and Moonlight Silver variants. But note that both come only in 46mm size. This could be a problem for people with thinner wrists as it looks inappropriately large. Also, you will have to pull the strap tight to get the watch to sit flat on the wrist so that it doesn\u2019t wobble much. There\u2019s no Corning Gorilla Glass protection and the steel case doesn\u2019t protrude along the sides of the display. So you will need to be careful to avoid a cracked screen.\n\nThe OnePlus Watch offers a silicon band with a pin-strap mechanism as you see on the\n\n. It\u2019s interesting that OnePlus did not opt for a buckle system particularly because the brand wanted the device to look like a traditional analog watch. The band is soft, comfortable and it\u2019s easy to keep it clean.\n\nTalking about the display, you get a 1.39-inch HD AMOLED panel. The display is bright with good colour reproduction. Sunlight legibility is decent with a pixel density of 326ppi. The touchscreen is responsive and there are no noticeable lags while navigating on this display. But there\u2019s a huge round bezel that you need to hide with a watch face of dark colour. In fact, it seems as if the bezel itself has pushed OnePlus to opt for a 46mm case.\n\nAs far as watch faces are concerned, you are restricted to the OnePlus Health app only. There are enough watch face options but you can\u2019t customise and third-party watch faces are not supported.\n\nYou don\u2019t get an always-on display and you can set the screen timeout to a maximum of 60 seconds. This means you will have to tap the screen to glance at the time or turn on the \u2018Raise to Wake\u2019 option inside settings. With this feature, the moment you turn the wrist, the display lights up.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a well-made watch but there\u2019s nothing much in the design that differentiates the OnePlus Watch from the crowd. And not to offend anyone but this watch may appear too large on the wrists of most women and even men in India.\n\nOnePlus Watch: Features\n\n\n\nThe OnePlus Watch offers essential sensors to monitor heart rate, blood oxygen, sleep, stress, activities and more. There is a barometer and compass too. Workout modes include walking, jogging, running, marathon, outdoor cycling, indoor cycling, freestyle training, swimming among others. OnePlus is expected to roll out more workout modes later. You can take the OnePlus Watch for a swim as it\u2019s IP68-rated dust and water-resistant and has a 5ATM rating. The OnePlus Watch covers all features that are available with other devices in its price range.\n\nThe device is fairly accurate in measuring key metrics like heart rate and SpO2 along with calories and workouts. You can take calls and the audio quality is decent. Remember this watch needs to be connected to your phone always. You will get notifications on your wrist but you can\u2019t do much. It\u2019s just an extension of your phone and cannot replace your phone by any means.\n\nRead More:\n\nOnePlus also has a TV connect feature. This helps\n\nowners to control the TV with the watch. We couldn\u2019t test this feature though as we didn\u2019t have an OnePlus TV at the time of this review.\n\nOnePlus Watch: Software and performance\n\nThe OnePlus Watch works with the OnePlus Health app. Right from the setup to daily functioning, you would need to use this app. The watch works with Android phones only and isn\u2019t compatible with iPhones. OnePlus isn\u2019t using Google\u2019s WearOS and the watch runs RTOS software. Given the mundane experience of using WearOS, we aren\u2019t complaining at all. However, you will not be happy with the OnePlus Health app. There\u2019s not many \u2018health details\u2019 present on the app and is quite buggy. The app tends to crash without any reason at times and the data may not get recorded on the app always.\n\nThe watch performs well and delivers on all its promises but the experience is not polished enough. OnePlus needs to improve on the software front to stand up to the \u2018flagship-killer\u2019 expectations-- something the brand takes pride in. The device connects easily via Bluetooth but you may witness instances where the connection drops on its own.\n\nRead More:\n\nOnePlus Watch: Battery life\n\nOnePlus boasts that the device lasts for 14 days on one full charge. But we could get around six days of battery life. A lot depends on how you use the watch. If you are monitoring SpO2 and heart rate a lot and tend to work out then you will get a maximum of around five days. Thankfully, OnePlus is offering fast charging and the device gets charged quickly. An hour of charging in a week should be sufficient for most users.\n\n: Verdict\n\nThe new OnePlus Watch is a stylish wearable that scores high on design. Performance and built wise too the watch will impress users. However, OnePlus needs to work on its software to provide an improved experience and also the OnePlus Health app needs some major updates. No doubt that it\u2019s a bold attempt from OnePlus but given the price, features and overall experience, the OnePlus Watch is not compelling enough.\n\nOnePlus Watch Features Water Resistant Screen size 1.39 Inch Price in india 16999 see full specifications \u276f\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin",

        "title": "facebook: Facebook board upholds Trump suspension",
        "text": "Former President Donald\n\nwon't return to\n\n- for now.\n\nThe social network's quasi-independent Oversight Board voted to uphold his ban from the platform after his account was suspended four months ago for inciting violence that led to the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot.\n\nWhile upholding the suspension, the board faulted Facebook in a statement for the way it made the decision.\n\nThe board said the ongoing risk of serious violence justified Facebook's suspension at the time, but said it \"was not appropriate for Facebook to impose an 'indefinite' suspension.\"\n\nThe board said Facebook was seeking to avoid its responsibilities by applying \"a vague, standardless penalty\" and then referring the case to the board to resolve.\n\n\"Indefinite penalties of this sort do not pass the international smell test,\" oversight board co-chari Michael McConnell said in a conference call with reporters. \"We are not cops, reigning over the realm of\n\n.\"\n\nThe board agreed with Facebook that that two of Trump's Jan. 6 posts \"severely violated\" the content standards of both Facebook and Instagram.\n\n\"We love you. You're very special,\" he said to the rioters in the first post. In the second, he called them \"great patriots\" and told them to \"remember this day forever\" in the second. Those violated Facebook's rules against praising or supporting people engaged in violence, the board said.\n\nHelle Thorning-Schmidt, a former Danish prime minister who sits on the board, said in the call that Facebook shirked its responsibility to enforce its own rules. \"Facebook should either permanently disable Trump's account or propose a suspension for a specific period of time,\" she said.\n\nThe board says Facebook has six months to reexamine the \"arbitrary penalty\" it imposed on Jan. 7 and decide on another penalty that reflects the \"gravity of the violation and the prospect of future harm.\"\n\nIt didn't say exactly how Facebook should do this, but offered a number of recommendations. One advised against drawing a firm distinction between political leaders and other influential users because anyone with a big audience can potentially cause serious risks of harm.\n\nThorning-Schmidt said considerations of newsworthiness should \"never\" take priority over the risk of harm.\n\nThe board also says Facebook should publicly explain the rules that it uses to sanction influential users, and emphasized the need for time-bound suspensions and clear rules on how they can be lifted.\n\nThe board says the new penalty must be \"clear, necessary and proportionate\" and consistent with Facebook's rules for severe violations.\n\nThe board says if Facebook decides to restore Trump's accounts, the company must be able to promptly address further violations.\n\nA Trump spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe board, which has 20 members and will eventually grow to 40, did not reveal how it voted. It said a minority of members emphasized that Facebook should require users who seek reinstatement after being suspended to \"recognize their wrongdoing and commit to observing the rules in the future.\"\n\nTrump has also been permanently banned from Twitter.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nSince the day after the deadly riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, former President Donald Trump's social media accounts have been silent - muzzled for inciting violence using the platforms as online megaphones.\n\nOn Wednesday, his fate on Facebook, the biggest social platform around, will be decided. The company's quasi-independent Oversight Board will announce its ruling around 9 a.m. ET. If it rules in Trump's favor, Facebook has seven days to reinstate the account. If the board upholds Facebook's decision, Trump will remain \"indefinitely\" suspended.\n\nPoliticians, free speech experts and activists around the world are watching the decision closely. It has implications not only for Trump but for tech companies, world leaders and people across the political spectrum - many of whom have wildly conflicting views of the proper role for technology companies when it comes to regulating online speech and protecting people from abuse and misinformation.\n\nAfter years of handling Trump's inflammatory rhetoric with a light touch, Facebook and Instagram took the drastic step of silencing his accounts in January. In announcing the unprecedented move, Facebook CEO\n\nsaid the risk of allowing Trump to continue using the platform was too great.\n\n\"The shocking events of the last 24 hours clearly demonstrate that President Donald Trump intends to use his remaining time in office to undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power to his elected successor, Joe Biden,\" Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page on Jan. 7.\n\nA day before the announcement, Trump unveiled a new blog on his personal website, \"From the Desk of Donald J. Trump.\" While the page includes a dramatic video claiming, \"A BEACON OF FREEDOM ARISES\" and hailing \"A PLACE TO SPEAK FREELY AND SAFELY,\" the page is little more than a display of Trump's recent statements - available elsewhere on the website - that can be easily shared on Facebook and Twitter, the platforms that banished him after the riot.\n\nWhile Trump aides have spent months teasing his plans to launch his own social media platform, his spokesman Jason Miller said the blog was something separate.\n\n\"President Trump's website is a great resource to find his latest statements and highlights from his first term in office, but this is not a new social media platform,\" he tweeted. \"We'll have additional information coming on that front in the very near future.\"\n\nBarred from social media, Trump has embraced other platforms for getting his message out. He does frequent interviews with friendly news outlets and has emailed a flurry of statements to reporters through his official office and political group.\n\nTrump has even said he prefers the statements to his old tweets, often describing them as more \"elegant.\"\n\nFacebook created the oversight panel to rule on thorny content on its platforms following widespread criticism of its difficulty responding swiftly and effectively to misinformation, hate speech and nefarious influence campaigns. Its decisions so far - all nine of them - have tended to favor free expression over the restriction of content.\n\nIn its first rulings, the panel overturned four out of five decisions by the social network to take down questionable material. It ordered Facebook to restore posts by users that the company said broke standards on adult nudity, hate speech, or dangerous individuals.\n\nCritics of Facebook, however, worry that the Oversight Board is a mere distraction from the company's deeper problems - ones that can't be addressed in a handful of high-profile cases by a semi-independent body of experts.\n\n\"Facebook set the rules, are judge, jury and executioner and control their own appeals court and their own\n\n. The decisions they make have an impact on our democracies, national security and biosecurity and cannot be left to their own in house theatre of the absurd,\" said Imran Ahmed, CEO Center for Countering Digital Hate, a nonprofit critical of Facebook. \"Whatever the judgement tomorrow, this whole fiasco shows why we need democratic regulation of\n\n.\"\n\nGautam Hans, a technology law and free speech expert and professor at\n\n, said he finds the Oversight Board structure to be \"frustrating and a bit of a sideshow from the larger policy and social questions that we have about these companies.\"\n\n\"To some degree, Facebook is trying to create an accountability mechanism that I think undermines efforts to have government regulation and legislation,\" Hans said. \"If any other company decided, well, we're just going to outsource our decision-making to some quasi-independent body, that would be thought of as ridiculous.\"",

However, companies like Xiaomi, Samsung, Vivo, Oppo, Huawei and Honor now offer 'Dual Apps' or 'Dual Mode' feature (the name may differ from brand to brand) which allows users to run two different accounts of the same chat app.\n\nThis means you need not carry two smartphones just to use two WhatsApp accounts. Wondering how? Here's a ready-to-use guide.\n\nFirst, let's start with the name and location every manufacturer uses for this feature:\n\nSamsung: Dual Messenger\n\nSettings > Advance features > Dual Messenger\n\nXiaomi (MIUI): Dual apps\n\nSettings > Dual Apps\n\nOppo: Clone Apps\n\nSettings > Clone Apps\n\nVivo: App clone\n\nSettings > App clone\n\nAsus: Twin apps\n\nSettings > Twin apps\n\nHuawei and Honor: App Twin\n\nSettings> App Twin\n\nNow, how to use\n\nfeature on your smartphone.\n\n1.

Configure using another phone number and get going.\n\nDo note that there are a few phones -- Android One devices and those offering 'stock' Android -- that do not come with dual app features . For these, there are several apps such as Parallel, Dual App Wizard, DoubleApp and more available on Google Play Store.

Users can even draw and capture a particular area. Although it still misses out on Mac-like resolution based or aspect ratio based screenshot features, it does offer sketching options, in case anyone wants to highlight anything important.\n\nNow, there are several ways to take screenshots on Windows 10 PC and here we are with 6-ways you can do that on Windows.\n\n1. Using good old Snipping tools Although the snipping tool has been replaced by the Snip & Sketch app, it still comes pre-installed with almost every Windows 10 copy. Snipping tool is still a very feature-rich tool as it offers options to select areas manually, option to take delayed screenshots and more.\n\n2. Using Snip & Sketch Open the app and click on the New button. Select the screen area you want to capture to take the screenshot.\n\n3. Using the PrintScreen keyboard button or PrtSc button This is the oldest trick in the book. Press the button, it will automatically capture and save the entire screen to clipboard and you\u2019ll have to paste it manually in paint or any other image processing software.\n\n4. Using Win + PrtSc button Win key extends the functionality of the PrtSc button by saving the screenshot right into the screenshots folder under the Pictures section in C drive.\n\n5. Using Xbox Game Bar The Xbox Game Bar also comes with a built-in screenshot option. Open Game Bar and tap on the camera icon to take the screenshot of the entire screen.

Here is how you can do it:\n\n1. Go to the video you want to save\n\n2. Below the video you will find the second option from the right as Download\n\n3.

However, the downloaded videos can be played offline for a continuous period of up to 48 hours. After that, you will need to reconnect your device to a mobile or Wi-Fi network after every 48 hours so that the app can check in case there is a change in the video or its availability for offline viewing remains. Therefore, if a video is no longer available for offline playback, it will be removed from your device during the next sync. These videos can be downloaded via both Wi-Fi and mobile data. Also, not all videos on YouTube are available for offline viewing.\n\nFor those who are short on internal storage, these downloaded videos can be saved to the SD card also.

        "title": "Google I/O 2021: Event Date, What to Expect, and More",
        "text": "Google had to entirely cancel its I/O developer conference last year due to the coronavirus pandemic, but the company is prepared to make some \u2018significant announcements\u2019 this time around. This year, Google I/O 2021 is free for everyone, and the Mountain View giant announced the dates of the event earlier this month. Google I/O 2021 is entirely virtual, and in this article, we will take a look at the expected announcements at the event.\n\nGoogle I/O 2021 Dates\n\nTo recall, Google I/O 2021 is all set to be held from May 18 to May 20. You can register for the event right now from Google\u2019s dedicated event website. After registration, you can attend workshops, AMA sessions, live Q&A during sessions, get developer profile badges, and more during the event. Apart from this, we could also expect key consumer-centric product announcements at the event.\n\nWatch Google I/O 2021\n\nAs always, you can watch Google I/O 2021 keynote from Google\u2019s official YouTube channel. The event link is not available as of this writing, but we will update this post with the event link when it becomes available. Further, you can stay tuned to the I/O website for specific events.\n\nExpectations for Google I/O 2021 Keynote\n\nWith the basics out of the way, let\u2019s get to the exciting hardware and software you can expect to be announced at the event:\n\nAndroid 12\n\nAndroid 12 will be one of the key highlights at the event. While Google won\u2019t roll out the finalized build of Android 12 to Pixel phones soon after the event ends, you could expect the first Android 12 beta release. Meanwhile, you can catch up on the best Android 12 features from our linked article.\n\nIn case you\u2019re out of the loop, Google has already released three developer previews. Going forward, there will be four beta releases in May, June, July, and August, respectively. Android 12 will reach platform stability in August, and you could expect the stable Android 12 release sometime in September.\n\nLike last year, we could expect Android 12 beta builds from OEM partners for specific devices alongside Pixel phones. Notably, this will be the last major Android update for Pixel 3 and 3 XL. Here are the Pixel devices that will get Android 12:\n\nGoogle Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL\n\nPixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL\n\nGoogle Pixel 4\n\nPixel 4a and Pixel 4a (5G)\n\nGoogle Pixel 5\n\nGoogle Pixel 5a\n\nAlright, let\u2019s talk about the Pixel 5a. Following rumors of Pixel 5a\u2019s cancelation, Google stepped up to reveal that the Pixel 5a is not canceled and will launch later this year. In addition, the company also revealed we could expect the device launch to be in line with last year\u2019s Pixel 4a unveiling. In case you don\u2019t remember, Pixel 4a launched in August last year.\n\nHere\u2019s where things get interesting. In an ideal world, Google would have announced the Pixel 4a at I/O 2020, just like how it revealed the Pixel 3a series at I/O 2019. However, since I/O 2020 didn\u2019t happen, the launch was pushed to August. Going by these, there\u2019s a chance that Google could announce the Pixel 5a at I/O 2021, with market availability set for August or even June.\n\nOn the hardware front, the Pixel 5a 5G is rumored to pack a 6.2-inch Full-HD+ OLED display with the same Snapdragon 765 SoC seen on the Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5. With all that said, one area where there\u2019s little to no reason to be excited about is availability. A Google spokesperson has already confirmed that the Pixel 5a 5G will be limited to the U.S. and Japan.\n\nPixel 5a Launch in India?\n\nSo, what about the BIS certification of the alleged Pixel 5a with model number GR0M2 and that ET Telecom report shedding light on Google\u2019s grand India push? Well, we\u2019re not sure either. The global chip shortage has likely forced Google to hit the pause button on its ambitious plans to widen its presence in the country. If Google skips the Pixel 5a 5G launch in India, that could mean there will be no new budget Pixel phone in India this year. That leaves Pixel fans with Pixel 4a that made its way to India last October. Clearly, it is not a great time to be a Pixel fan in India, and the situation is far from ideal. C\u2019mon Google, do something.\n\nPixel Buds A\n\nGoogle Pixel Buds A is the company\u2019s upcoming truly wireless earbuds expected to launch at the event. It was rumored to launch sometime in April, and the next best timeline is at Google I/O 2021. Another evidence for its existence is a recent marketing email where Google accidentally leaked the Pixel Buds A design. Spoiler alert: They look pretty much like Pixel Buds 2, but with a green shade.\n\nIn terms of specifications, we don\u2019t know a lot about the Pixel Buds A. Judging by the \u2018A\u2019 in the branding, it could be a cheaper variant of the Pixel Buds. Further, a recent 9to5Google report suggests that the Pixel Buds A may lack gesture inputs for controlling the volume. Hence, do not get your hopes high for the new Pixel Buds A. We will have to wait a little longer for the true successor of Pixel Buds 2.\n\nWhitechapel Chipset Announcement?\n\nRumors about Google\u2019s in-house SoC codenamed Whitechapel started last year. After a year of silence, a 9to5Google report earlier this month further detailed Google\u2019s plans to use its own chipset, starting with the Pixel 6 5G. Google seems to have teamed up with Samsung Semiconductor\u2019s system large-scale integration (SLSI) division for the much-awaited Whitechapel chipset.\n\nSpeaking of the technical tidbits, as per recent reports, it will be an octa-core chipset manufactured on Samsung\u2019s 5nm process. It could include two ARM Cortex-A78 cores, two Cortex-A76 cores, and four Cortex-A55 cores. While you should not expect Google to announce the Pixel 6 at I/O 2021, it is likely that Google will announce the Whitechapel chipset so that developers know what to expect and how to prepare when it is ready.\n\nWear OS Improvements and New Nest Hardware\n\nNow that Google owns Fitbit, we could expect the company to announce improvements to Wear OS and Fitbit OS at I/O 2021. Interestingly, Google could drop \u2018OS\u2019 and simply call it Google Wear, as revealed in the I/O schedule. Another possible outcome is the announcement of new Nest hardware products. Another possibility is the rumored Pixel Watch, but even the leaks point to an October release date.\n\nIn Alphabet\u2019s Q1 2021 earnings call, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told investors to expect \u2018significant product updates and announcements.\u2019 Hence, there\u2019s room for a slew of product announcements at the event.\n\nImprovements to Google Assistant, Stadia\n\nGoogle usually announces massive improvements to its voice recognition technology at I/O, take Duplex, next-gen Google Assistant, for instance. Google I/O 2021 will be the perfect time for the company to show off advancements it has achieved with Assistant throughout the year. The company, however, has already announced a few Assistant updates, including pronunciation accuracy improvement and natural conversations using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). We could also get a glimpse of what the future holds for Stadia, Google\u2019s cloud gaming efforts.\n\nGoogle I/O 2021 Expectations\n\nSo, that sums up our expectations for Google I/O 2021. Which of these announcements are you most excited about? If I had to pick one, it would have to be Google\u2019s in-house Whitechapel chipset and its capabilities, followed closely by Android 12.

        "title": "Xiaomi Working on Three New High-End Android Tablets: Report",
        "text": "Xiaomi shifted its focus away from the tablet segment after launching the Mi Pad 4 back in 2018. With Xiaomi out of the equation, brands including Samsung, Huawei, Lenovo, and even Amazon with its Fire tablets dominated the Android tablets segment. However, if a new report from XDA Developers is anything to go by, it appears as though Xiaomi is planning to make a strong comeback in the foreseeable future.\n\nXiaomi\u2019s Upcoming Android Tablets\n\nAccording to the report, Xiaomi is allegedly working on at least three Android tablets. These devices have the codenames \u2018nabu\u2019, \u2018enuma\u2019, and \u2018elish\u2019 respectively. In addition, these codenames are referenced in methods like \u2018isPad\u2019 in the source code of multiple MIUI 12.5 system apps.\n\nApart from this, Xiaomi tipster kacskrz has spotted a settings page demonstrating system navigation for tablets in a recent alpha build of the MIUI Home app (version 4.22.0.3089). Take a look at the settings page below:\n\nThe report also reveals the model names of Xiaomi\u2019s upcoming tablets. While the devices with codenames \u2018enuma\u2019 and \u2018eilish\u2019 will have the model names K81 and K81A respectively, the tablet with the codename \u2018nabu\u2019 has the model name K82. In addition, it looks like just \u2018enuma\u2019 (K81) will offer LTE/5G cellular connectivity.\n\nComing to the key specifications, all three models are tipped to have an IPS LCD display with up to 120Hz refresh rate and 2560 x 1600 pixel resolution. Moreover, \u2018nabu\u2019 (K82) is likely to have a 10.97-inch display with 236mm x 148mm dimensions. It could also equip an 8,720mAh dual-cell battery. K81 and K81A are expected to feature chipsets built on Qualcomm\u2019s sm8250 platform \u2013 Snapdragon 865, 865+, or 870, while K82 could feature Qualcomm\u2019s sm8150 platform \u2013 Snapdragon 855, 855+, or 860.\n\nXiaomi has the infrastructure and potential to be a key player in the Android tablets industry. With these new tablets, the company could be looking to compete against the likes of Samsung and Apple. For now, we will have to wait to see when these tablets will see the light of day in the coming months. Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun has already confirmed that the company will launch new tablets sometime later this year.",

        "text": "India\u2019s Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has given mobile service providers, including Airtel, Reliance Jio, Vodafone Idea (Vi), and MTNL, permission to start 5G trials in the country. These network providers will conduct 5G trials across India and will cover rural, semi-urban, and urban areas.\n\n5G Trials in India\n\nFor conducting 5G trials, the aforesaid network operators will work with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM). While Reliance will use its own indigenous technology for network trials, other telecom companies have teamed up with Ericsson, Nokia, Samsung, and C-DOT. Notably, none of these OEMs are from China. This also means that Huawei and ZTE are not involved in India\u2019s 5G trials.\n\nTelecom operators will conduct trials across different 5G bands, including mid-band (3.2 GHz to 3.67 GHz), millimeter-wave band (24.25 GHz to 28.5 GHz), and sub-Gigahertz band (700 GHz). The trials are set for 6 months. The 6-month timeline includes 2 months period for procurement and setting up of the equipment.\n\nThese trials will be isolated and not connected with existing networks. Moreover, it will be held on a non-commercial basis, and data generated during the trials will be stored in India. The ministry also expects telcos to test indigenously developed use cases and equipment as part of the trials.\n\n\u201cThe objectives of conducting 5G trials include testing 5G spectrum propagation characteristics especially in the Indian context; model tuning and evaluation of chosen equipment and vendors; testing of indigenous technology; testing of applications (such as telemedicine, tele-education, augmented/ virtual reality, drone-based agricultural monitoring, etc.); and to test 5G phones and devices,\u201d DoT said in a press statement.\n\nThe government also urges telcos to conduct trials using 5Gi technology.

You can also edit and replace specific words in case the automated transcription has inaccurately added some words or if the transcription missed proper punctuation. All you have to do is tap on an individual word to make adjustments before posting the story.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Instagram users with hearing impairment will have to rely on creators to see captions. While this is a good first step, the success of the feature depends on the creators since viewers can\u2019t manually choose to turn it on, at least in the current implementation.\n\nInstagram is currently rolling out captions stickers \u2018in a handful of countries,\u2019 with plans to expand the availability of the feature to more regions soon. It is also worth noting that the feature is available only in English and in English-speaking countries at the moment.

In a now-deleted tweet (via 9to5Google) on the Android Twitter handle, the company teased the updated Fast Pair experience of the new Pixel Buds. The tweet further confirms that the company has planned to market the TWS earbuds as Pixel Buds A-series.\n\nPixel Buds A with Fast Pair\n\n\u201cQuality sound and quick Bluetooth pairing.

One noticeable design change is that Google is switching to white color inside the charging case, as opposed to the black accent seen on its predecessor. Thanks to the email leak, we already know that the company will have another white color variant with olive green ear tips and case interior.\n\nThe tweet, unfortunately, didn\u2019t reveal the pricing and availability of the earbuds. It didn\u2019t show off other key specifications either. What we know according to a recent 9to5Google report is that the earbuds may lack swipe volume gestures.

Anmol from our team spotted the test on his phone, running YouTube beta version 16.17.36. After a quick Twitter search, we noticed that YouTube started testing this change on both Android and iOS earlier last week.\n\nYouTube Shorts Tab in YouTube App\n\nTo put things in perspective, here is a comparison between the current YouTube app\u2019s home page and the upcoming redesign that should probably roll out soon. As seen in the image below, the Explore section is given less prominence in the test version. YouTube has shifted the Explore section to the top-left corner of the app, right where Shorts currently exists.\n\nYouTube\u2019s decision to move the Shorts tab to the bottom navigation bar doesn\u2019t come as a surprise, considering how much momentum short video apps like TikTok have gained lately. However, what I don\u2019t like about the new implementation is that the Shorts section continues to show up on the home page despite having a dedicated tab in the navbar. The idea of pushing Shorts through YouTube\u2019s home page even after giving it a prominent spot in the YouTube app feels like the company is trying too hard, at least in my opinion.\n\nAs of writing this article, YouTube has not widely rolled out the new Shorts tab just yet.

Dubbed the Realme Cobble Bluetooth speaker, one unique aspect of the new speaker is that its lanyard (read: strap) glows in the dark. Let\u2019s take a look at the complete specifications of Realme\u2019s latest Bluetooth speaker:\n\nRealme Cobble Bluetooth Speaker: Specifications\n\nRealme Cobble Bluetooth Speaker comes with 5W dynamic drivers and offers three equalizer presets \u2013 Bass, Dynamic, and Bright. You can pair two speakers together for stereo sound.\n\nFor connectivity, the speaker utilizes Bluetooth 5.0 with a range of 10 meters. The speaker supports AAC and SBC codecs. Realme has also added a Game Mode that claims to bring the latency down to up to 88ms while playing games or watching videos.\n\nAt 200 grams, the Cobble Bluetooth speaker is portable and you can easily clip it to your backpack or hang it in your dorm room. Moreover, the IPX5 water resistance should protect the speaker from occasional splashes. Coming to the fancy glowing effect, it is worth pointing out that just the blue version\u2019s lanyard has this characteristic. In other words, the Black variant of the speaker won\u2019t glow in the dark.\n\nThe 1500mAh battery on the speaker lasts up to 9 hours, Realme claims. Charging the speaker completely will take approximately 2.5 hours. Fortunately, Realme has used a USB-C port on this one. You can use the Realme Link app to customize the preferences for the speaker.\n\nPrice and Availability\n\nThe Realme Cobble Bluetooth Speaker is available in Electric Blue and Metal Black color variants. It costs 99 MYR, which roughly translates to Rs. 1,800. There\u2019s no word on the availability in other regions just yet, but we will keep you updated if Realme brings this speaker to India.",

        "text": "On the first day of the Apple vs Epic Games trial set in Oakland, California, lawyers representing Apple and Epic Games put forth their stances. While Epic highlighted Apple\u2019s walled garden and how the company is being monopolistic with the way it handles software distribution on iOS along with 30 percent commission, Apple argued that Epic Games wants them to be Android.\n\nEpic Games Wants Us to Be Android: Apple\n\n\u201cEpic wants us to be Android, but we don\u2019t want to be. And our consumers don\u2019t want that either. They want the choice,\u201d Apple lawyer Karen Dunn was quoted as saying by CNBC. It was further added that Apple built the iOS App Store and gets to set the rules and policies, ensuring that the apps uploaded by developers are high-quality and secure. That is also a reason why the Cupertino giant does not allow side-loading apps like Android.\n\nThe development comes when Apple and Epic\u2019s lawyers made their opening statements. Epic went ahead and showed a walled garden in its presentation. You can go through the slideshows showing Apple\u2019s and Epic\u2019s slides over at The Verge.\n\nIt all started when Epic Games decided to sue Apple for removing Fortnite from the App Store. Apple even terminated Epic Games\u2019 developer account weeks after the incident. In case you\u2019re out of the loop, Apple removed Fortnite because Epic introduced a direct payment system that bypasses Apple\u2019s 30 percent cut.\n\nThis is just the beginning of the trial. Over the coming weeks, key tech personalities from Apple including Tim Cook, Eddy Cue, Craig Federighi, Phill Schiller, and more are expected to testify. Some of these will be in-person while some will happen through Zoom. The entire trial is expected to last three weeks.\n\nIf Epic wins the trial, Apple may get forced to allow third-party payment methods for apps in the App Store. Another possibility in the instance of a favorable ruling is the permission to set up its own app store. That would mean Epic Store offering apps and games on the iPhone. Right now, we\u2019ll have to wait to see how the story unfolds.",

According to a recent tweet on the company\u2019s official Twitter handle, Redmi will launch the smartwatch alongside Redmi Note 10S in the country on May 13.\n\nRedmi has set up a dedicated event page for the product launch. From this page, it\u2019s clear that the upcoming product is indeed the Redmi Watch. Take a look at the announcement tweet below:\n\nGet ready to #WearYourVibe peeps! \ud83d\ude0e#Redmi's FIRST<hush hush> is all set to arrive with the #SavageBeast #RedmiNote10S on 13/05/21! \ud83e\udd73 Got what it takes to pass that #vibecheck? \u2705\n\nKeep your eyes on our page! \ud83d\udc40 Get Notified: https://t.co/YHvH7ZBIgR RT if we got you vibin! pic.twitter.com/Lf7uHcyWdn \u2014 Redmi India \u2013 #RedmiNote10 Series (@RedmiIndia) May 4, 2021\n\nRedmi Watch: Specifications\n\nSince Redmi has already launched the Redmi Watch in China last November, we know the key specifications of the gadget. This smartwatch launched globally as the Mi Watch Lite.\n\nTo recall, the smartwatch sports a 1.4-inch square color LCD touch panel with 323 PPI. You get over 200 watch faces to customize the look and feel. Health-related features include 30-day heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, 11 sports modes, and more.\n\nOne key difference with the Redmi Watch coming to India is GPS support. Unlike the Chinese variant that lacks built-in GPS, the Indian Redmi Watch variant will offer built-in GPS/GLONASS for navigation. This way, you don\u2019t have to carry your phone if you\u2019re going for a walk or a cycle ride. This puts the upcoming Redmi Watch closer to the Mi Watch Lite than its Chinese variant.\n\nSince Xiaomi is known to follow an aggressive pricing strategy for Redmi devices, it will be interesting to see how the upcoming wearable is priced in India. The presence of onboard GPS support should make the gadget an appealing choice in the country. We\u2019ll be covering Redmi\u2019s launch event on May 13 as it happens, so stay tuned for more details.",

The browser offers a lot of useful features, support for Chrome extensions, and more. And now, Microsoft seems to be working on yet another useful feature for it.\n\nAccording to the latest Edge Dev channel update, Microsoft is testing a new Office file viewer inside the Edge browser. The option was enabled by default for me with the latest Edge Dev 92.0.873.1 update. However, if you don\u2019t have it enabled, here\u2019s where you can find it.\n\nGo to edge://settings -> Downloads. You will find the new \u201cQuickly view Office files on the web using Office Viewer\u201d option here. Just enable the toggle and you\u2019re good to go.\n\nSo what does this feature do? Well, up until now, if you searched for presentations, Word documents, or even spreadsheets online and clicked on a direct link to a ppt, docx, or xls file, your browser would just download it. With this new feature, however, the file will open in the Edge browser itself. In fact, for things like presentations, you also get a handy slideshow mode within the browser now, as well as a Notes pane.\n\nIf you actually intended on downloading the file, you can still use the Download button in the toolbar to download the presentation or document to your computer. If you use Bing Search, the functionality has been integrated into it pretty well too. Basically, for links leading to Office Files, you will now see a handy \u2018Web View\u2019 option right next to the link which will open up the file inside Edge\u2019s new Office Viewer.\n\nThis feature should prove way more useful to students than it will ever prove for me, but I\u2019m fairly excited about it, even if I\u2019ll only ever use it a couple of times in my life. As mentioned above, the feature is available in Edge Dev, and not on the stable channel. So, there\u2019s no telling when (or if) it will be made available to the wider public, but stay tuned.",

You can simply tap your phone on a compatible payment terminal (currently only PineLabs POS systems are supported), and your phone will automatically launch Google Pay. Then, you can simply enter the amount to be paid, followed by your UPI pin, to complete the payment.\n\nObviously, you will need to have a smartphone with an NFC chip inside, and Google has some more security standards as well. Right now, it seems the feature will only be available on Android phones. Google says that your phone\u2019s software should be Play Protect certified for the feature to work.

The smartphone launches in the country in 10 days, on May 13, as per a tweet by Xiaomi India MD, Manu Kumar Jain.\n\nMi Fans, get ready for the most #Savage #RedmiNote of 'em all. Savage #Performance meets Stunning #Camera with all-new #RedmiNote10S. \u26a1 Join us as we unveil this BEAST at a special #LaunchFromHome event on 13th May! \ud83c\udfe1 RT & get notified: https://t.co/TnHWHCOAYN I \u2764\ufe0f #Redmi pic.twitter.com/FfADJkHA5H \u2014 Manu Kumar Jain (@manukumarjain) May 3, 2021\n\nThanks to the global launch, we already know everything there is to know about the smartphone, including the design and all the tech specs you may want to be aware of. The Redmi Note 10S\u2019 design is reminiscent of the recently launched Mi 11X as well as the Redmi Note 10 series, especially as far as the camera module is concerned. That said, the Redmi Note 10S\u2019 camera module is slightly more squared off than the one on the Mi 11X.\n\nIn terms of specs, the Redmi Note 10S will come with a 6.43-inch AMOLED display, with a resolution of 2400\u00d71080, DCI-P3 color gamut, 409PPI pixel density, and 1100nits of peak brightness.\n\nUnder the hood, the phone is powered by the MediaTek Helio G95 processor that has a Mali-G76 MC4 GPU for gaming and graphics. In the global markets, Xiaomi has launched the Redmi Note 10S in three variants: a 6GB/64GB option, 6GB/128GB option, and an 8GB/128GB option at the highest-end. These storages are all UFS 2.2, so not the fastest options out there.\n\nThe smartphone will also pack in a quad-rear camera setup. That includes a 64MP primary rear camera. This will be coupled with an 8MP ultra-wide, a 2MP macro, and a 2MP depth sensor. A 13MP front camera for selfies will also be in tow. All of that, with a pretty chunky 5,000mAh battery complete with support for 33W fast-charging will round this phone off as a pretty solid contender in the space.\n\nWe don\u2019t know the price that the Redmi Note 10S will be launched at in India. However, it is expected to be within the Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 15,000 price bracket. It will also be interesting to see how the phone fits in alongside the Redmi Note 10 series, which is priced starting at Rs. 12,499.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Redmi Note 10S launches on May 13 in India, and we will be covering the launch, so stay tuned for more updates.",

        "text": "Since the ban on PUBG Mobile, imposed by the Indian government last year, fans of the popular battle royale game have been itching for its relaunch in the country. Over the course of the last months we have seen a number of hints that the game might be re-launched in the country really soon. Now, a new reveal is out, hinting that the game might relaunch with a completely new name, and it\u2019s not going to be PUBG Mobile India.\n\nAccording to a new poster for the game spotted by the folks over at Gemwire, Krafton and PUBG Corp. are likely to release the game under the name \u2018Battlegrounds Mobile\u2019. The new poster was spotted by Gemwire within the source code for the PUBG Mobile India website. For those unaware, the website went live late last year when the developers announced that they will be relaunching the game soon.\n\nThe poster, shown in the image above, has the image of a PUBG player landing on what looks to be Miramar (or the new Karakin map), with the text Battlegrounds Mobile India written in the sandy terrain.\n\nAs for the actual launch, there is yet to be any official announcement, but recent developments have definitely amped up expectations yet again. Krafton recently posted more job listings related to PUBG Mobile India on LinkedIn. Moreover, the company has stated in interviews that it is focused on the PUBG Mobile relaunch instead of bringing the newly announced PUBG: New State to the country. What\u2019s more, a bunch of PUBG Mobile India teaser videos went live on the official YouTube channel a few days ago, adding more fuel to the fire. The videos have been made private since then, but their appearance does seem to indicate that the game\u2019s launch, hopefully, is just around the corner.\n\nMeanwhile, even as Krafton struggles to bring PUBG Mobile back, EA\u2019s Apex Legends has started its closed beta in the country, and FAU-G\u2019s Team Deathmatch mode is on the way as well. It remains to be seen how well \u2018Battlegrounds Mobile\u2019 will be able to fare in a more competitive mobile gaming scene in India.",

        "text": "Ever since Samsung launched its first Galaxy Fold foldable smartphone, the company has been expanding its line up, releasing smartphones such as the Galaxy Z Fold 2 and the Galaxy Z Flip in the market. Now, after releasing three new Galaxy Book laptops and 2-in-1 devices at its recent \u201cUnpacked\u201d event, the Korean company is looking to release two new foldable devices in the coming days, namely the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and the Galaxy Z Flip 3. And recent leaks show the devices in all their glory.\n\nSo, ahead of their potential release in the coming weeks, promotional images of the book-style foldable Galaxy Z Fold 3 and the clamshell-style foldable Galaxy Z Flip 3 leaked online recently. The images show the designs and the physical form factor of the devices.\n\nGalaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3 Images Leaked\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold (Leaked)\n\nStarting with the Galaxy Z Fold 3, as per the leaked images, we can see that the device comes with a vertical triple-camera module that looks pretty different from the Contour-cut camera design of the latest Galaxy S21-series.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nMoreover, there is an image of the Galaxy Fold 3 that shows the device with the S-Pen, confirming previous rumors about the device. Furthermore, it is slated to be the world\u2019s first foldable smartphone with an under-display selfie snapper and come with a new Hybrid S-Pen.\n\nMoreover, Samsung will also reportedly integrate a new \u201cArmor\u201d into the display, hinge, and bezel to improve the durability of the device. Besides, the outer screen will reportedly come with the Gorilla Glass Victus for better drop protection and preventing scratches. It will come in three new colors \u2013 black, white, and a sea-green-like color scheme.\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 3 (Leaked)\n\nComing to the Galaxy Z Flip 3, the leaked images suggest that the device will come in a variety of colors. In fact, Samsung, as per the images, has implemented a new two-tone color design for the Galaxy Z Flip 3 that subtly hides the front cover display.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nMoreover, the cover display can now show more information than the cover display on the previous Galaxy Z Flip. As per a leaked image, unlike on the cover display of the previous iteration, you will be able to read a whole text message on the new cover display of the upcoming Galaxy Z Flip 3. Plus, it will also reportedly come with the Gorilla Glass Victus.\n\nComing to the cameras, we can see a dual-camera setup beside the cover display. Although not much information is available about the optics of the device as of now, it should bring significant improvement over its predecessor.\n\nAvailability (Rumored)\n\nComing to the launch date of the devices, Samsung has not officially confirmed anything. However, as per reports and the leaked Samsung product roadmap, the company might release the devices sometime in July this year. So, stay tuned for more information in the coming weeks.",

        "text": "Over the past few years, we have seen a rise in popularity, as well as values of various cryptocurrencies in the market. Amongst some of the most popular ones like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum, Dogecoin, which is a cryptocurrency based on a meme, saw a huge surge in its value when billionaire Elon Musk started tweeting about it. And going by Elon\u2019s words, a 33-year-old now says that he has become a millionaire by investing in the said cryptocurrency.\n\nGlauber Contessoto is 33 years old and is a resident of Los Angeles. The guy is a fan of the Tesla CEO and after Musk started tweeting about Dogecoin a few months ago, Contessoto went in and bought 5 million Dogecoins at around $0.045 (~Rs. 3.3) on February 5.\n\nOn April 15, Contessoto shared a screenshot (attached below) of his Robinhood account on the r/dogecoin subreddit that showed the value of his investment to be a little over $1 million. So, it took around 69 days for him to become a Dogecoin millionaire.\n\nNow, after buying the initial 5 million Dogecoin, Contessoto shared a video on his YouTube channel to explain the top 5 reasons that drove him to invest in cryptocurrency. You can check out the 18-minute video right below:\n\nSo, in the video, Contessoto says after Elon Musk started tweeting about Dogecoin, he decided to invest in it. As a result, he took out all the savings from his bank accounts, sold his shares of Tesla, Uber, and invested every penny to buy the initial Dogecoins.\n\nAlthough many of his friends and family member warned him about the risks involved, he chose to stick to his plan of becoming a Dogecoin millionaire.

        "text": "As global climate change continues to impact the environment, the need for the hour demands better waste management techniques to reduce the amount of waste in the world. Amongst others, food waste is comparatively easier to manage as it can be turned into nutrient-rich composts. However, the process of composting is long-drawn and time-consuming. So, to let people easily compost food waste at their homes, a Canada-based company has created a mini composter that turns food waste into compost with a push of a button.\n\nLomi: Compact Home Composter\n\nDeveloped by Pela, Lomi is essentially a rice-cooker-shaped device that can convert biodegradable waste into nutrient-rich compost. As a result, users can throw in just about anything biodegradable, including food waste, those wooden cutleries that you get with food deliveries, and even the company\u2019s compostable phone cases to turn them into mess-free, odorless compost. It uses heat, abrasion, and oxygen to turn the waste into environment-friendly compost.\n\nThe company says that North America alone generates around 330 billion pounds of food waste each year. These add up with the plastic and other non-biodegradable waste to fill up landfills and cause global warming. So, with Lomi, Pela wanted to eliminate food waste from the mix to reduce the cumulative amount of waste.\n\nThe company says that it worked on Lomi for three years, trying out thousands of composting processes. Following the initial researches, the team spent a lot of time prototyping the device to make it compact and house-friendly. And now, Pela is finally ready to mass-produce Lomi to deliver it to customers around the world.\n\nPrice and Availability\n\nThe company is currently running an Indiegogo campaign for Lomi and has already raised close to $4 million from over 11,000 backers. So, if you want to pre-book the device from the campaign page.\n\nThe device is priced at $379 (~Rs 28,082) for people living in Canada, Puerto Rico, and the USA. Other than these countries, the international model, which the company will ship to any country in the world, comes for $399 (~Rs 29,564).",

        "title": "20 Best Instagram Reels Tips and Tricks",
        "text": "Instagram Reels, along with YouTube Shorts, has emerged as one of the most popular TikTok alternatives. Featuring a wide array of AR effects, hilarious stickers, and a solid library of music for lip-syncing videos, Reels has got almost everything covered to be a hot pick among both creators, as well as folks who wish to experiment with short-form videos. Whether you are a newbie or hunting for hacks to enhance your skill, these are the 20 best Instagram Reels tips and tricks that can help you step up your game.\n\nBest Instagram Reels Tips and Tricks for 2021\n\nAs a creator, we aspire to be one of the best in the business. Producing highly engaging videos that can grab eyeballs and compel onlookers to send a ton of hearts is where the bucks stop. But how do you create attention-grabbing content, and what are the tools required to make pro-level Instagram Reels?\n\nWell, we have taken all the aspects into account and included tips that can help boost your fortune on the short video-sharing platform. Now let\u2019s dive in and take a look at the top Instagram Reels tips and tricks in 2021.\n\n1. Find Your Niche and Post Clips Frequently\n\nYou don\u2019t want to be a jack of all trades, do you? While there is nothing wrong with being a person who can be good in several departments, you should always strive to be the master of one craft. It is essential if you dream of becoming one of the most loved Instagram Reels creators.\n\nWhat are you good at? Do you have the dancing skill that can steal the show? Can you attract viewers with your looks and lip-sync craft? Do you have a passion for flaunting a chiseled body and beefed up muscles, or do you have the heart to perform jaw-dropping stunts?\n\nAll I\u2019m trying to stress is that you need to find the niche you wish to rule and go all out to put your best effort. Remember, when you have only a few seconds to impress, nothing less than a blitzkrieg or admirable reel can garner hearts and likes.\n\n2. Presentation Matters\n\nBefore you create a Reel, ask yourself a couple of simple questions. Why may anyone want to watch the clip? And what could be the right pitch for your reel? These couple of questions can help you prepare and keep any oversights at bay, which are common when you go all-in with very little preparation.\n\nOnce you have answered the fundamental questions, craft the presentation with precision. Think about each move and the impact it will leave behind. You can check out one of our cool \u2018How did we go from this to that\u2019 Instagram Reel right here. The timing and precision of your moves are important to gravitate users towards your content.\n\n3. 30/60 Seconds is Always Better Than 15 Seconds\n\nAt launch, Instagram Reels allowed users to record only 15 seconds of video. However, when creators asked for a bit more freedom in terms of time, the Facebook-owned video-sharing platform had to double the video recording time. And now, it has bumped the video recording time even further, all the way to 60 seconds.\n\nSo, if you are still stuck at the 15 seconds loop or don\u2019t know how to increase the length, let me tell you that switching between 15, 30, or 60 seconds is pretty straightforward. Tap on the tiny circle button (showing 15 seconds by default) at the top of the camera tools to hop between 15, 30, or 60 seconds.\n\n4. Hidden Tool to Adjust Video Length\n\nHave you ever wished to adjust the length of your Instagram Reels after recording but don\u2019t know how to do it? It happened to me when I started taking an interest in Reels and wanted to create some funky clips. But just when I was about to look for third-party tools to fine-tune the length of Instagram Reels, I discovered the hidden tool inside the Timer itself.\n\nTo get going, tap on the video length button to switch between 15, 30, or 60 seconds. Then, tap on the Timer button. After that, drag the slider to adjust the length of the video. Besides, you can also adjust the countdown before you go ahead and record your clip.\n\n5. Get Your Timing Right\n\nConsidering how pivotal timing is for perfecting each move or expression, you should never miss out on any trick to get as close to perfection as you can. Before getting into action, tap on the timer button. After that, tap on the tiny button next to the countdown to switch between 3s and 10s seconds. Next, tap on Set Timer.\n\n6. Never Forget to Align Your Instagram Reels\n\nThis is the Instagram Reels trick that should stick with your forever. The Reels feature comes with a built-in video alignment tool that you can use to align your clips with ease. Once you have recorded the video, tap on the video alignment button. It gets the job done reliably and without hampering your productivity.\n\n7. Slow Down or Speed Up Your Video\n\nOne of my favorite Instagram Reels features is the native speed adjustment tool. Whether you want to slow down your reel or speed it up to make it appear more dramatic, you don\u2019t need to look anywhere else to fine-tune the speed of your video.\n\nBefore recording the clip or after you have captured the video, hit the speed button (1x) and select the desired option. While .3x and .5x allow you to slow down your clip, the 1x, 2x, 3x, and 4x let you speed it up.\n\n8. Experiment with Effects & AR Filters\n\nInstagram Reels already boasts a ton of eye-catching effects. And if you think that the number is as good as the last time you strolled into the effects collection, you can\u2019t be more wrong. The video-sharing platform keeps rolling out new effects to let you spice up your video.\n\nSo, every time you wish to start or partake in an Instagram Reels trend, dive into the effects collection (tap on the effects button) and try out a myriad of effects until you are pleased.\n\n9. Keep Camera Tools at the Preferred Side\n\nWhile some folks prefer to keep things on the right-hand side, others like to go with the left-hand side option. It enables them to carry out their work more conveniently. That\u2019s probably the reason why Instagram Reels allow you to choose which side of the screen the camera toolbar should be.\n\nWhen recording a reel, tap on the settings button at the top left corner of the screen and then choose the left or right-hand option. The creation tools appear on the left by default. I think this is an essential trick for all Instagram Reels creators.\n\n10. Clip Your Music Precisely\n\nClipping music or selecting the desired part shouldn\u2019t be a hassle when you have a neat tool always ready to do the task for you. Simply, tap on the music button and then search for the songs you want to use. Once you have selected the preferred track, use the slider to choose the desired part of the track. It\u2019s that easy!\n\n11. Keep Your Captions Short and Precise\n\nCaptions that are short and sweet catch attention right away, while the ones that cover the entire screen fail to grab attention. The best way to nail Instagram Reels captions is to play with words. And with it, I mean using the caption that can send your message loud and clear at a glance, of course, without sacrificing the style factor.\n\n12. Use Eye-Catching Covers \u2013 Best Instagram Reels Trick\n\nThey rightly say, \u201cThe first impression is the last impression.\u201d Thus, make sure to design your Instagram Reels cover with precision so that it can best represent your video.\n\nBoth App Store and Play Store are loaded with a plethora of highly-rated photo editors. However, the ones that have always impressed me are Adobe Lightroom (iOS and Android; Free with in-app purchases), VSCO (iOS and Android; Free with in-app purchases), and Snapseed (iOS and Android). They are feature-rich and come with a wide range of photo editing tools to let you design your Reels cover. So, give them a shot and I\u2019m sure you would soon begin to see the difference.\n\nChanging Instagram Reels cover is easy. Tap on the video with the \u2018Caption\u2019 tag (on the sharing screen) and then hit the \u201cAdd from Camera Roll\u201d button. After that, select the custom cover.\n\n13. Automatically Save Your Instagram Reels to Your Device\n\nFor a keepsake, I prefer to save Instagram Reels on my device. Whenever I wish to go back in time and take a close look at all the clips that I have uploaded on the video-sharing platform, I can explore the collection at my own pace. If you also belong to the same school of thought, follow the steps below:\n\nTap on the settings icon at the top left corner. After that, tap on Reels.\n\nat the top left corner. After that, tap on Reels. Next, turn on the switch next to Save reels to device.\n\n14. Stay in Sync with Trends, But As a Trendsetter\n\nWhile it\u2019s always recommended to hop onto the latest trend to stay ahead of the curve, you must always add something new to the table. Think of adding quirky laughter into the mix or a peculiar expression with a wry smile or the childish face that compels onlookers to take notice.\n\nWhenever a piece of music or style tops the chart, many folks run after it so much that it begins to look redundant. While the ones who grabbed the trend early on with immaculate act run away with the hearts, mere followers hardly get much appreciation. The trick is either be the first (or among the first batch) or add something different to the concept to make it appear more striking.\n\n15. Use Third-party Video Editing Software\n\nDespite having a stunning lip-syncing or acting skill, your reel won\u2019t get the desired appreciation unless you\u2019ve edited it beautifully. Without undermining the plethora of effects and stickers that Reels come loaded with, I recommend you to make your clip using pro video editors.\n\nBelieve me, video editing had never been so easy-going before. Of course, it does take a while to master all the tricks of the trade, but there are quite a few super handy video editors that can let you adorn your clips instantly. And that too without being embroiled in a lengthy learning curve or tedious process. If you are willing to get started on the right note, check out our lineup of the best Instagram Reels video editors.\n\n16. Buy Lights for Your Instagram Reels Shoots\n\nWhen creating action-filled videos, the one thing that comes calling is the crazy lighting you want to use. After all, it\u2019s the light that invites the camera and action to kick in. Fortunately, getting the best lights for Reels is not a big deal, thanks in part to many highly-rated LED lights that you can buy from Amazon at $30-$50.\n\nMost of the LED lights work with the companion app on Android and iOS to let you customize colors based on the theme of the video. So, whether you want to brighten up the colors or wish to go vibrant, you can do it all and more with utmost ease.\n\n17. Never Settle with the Native Music Library\n\nMusic is the crux of any video, more so for the clips that have only a few seconds to leave a lasting impression. So, why settle with the songs that don\u2019t seem to gel along with your video? Agreed, Instagram Reels come with a boatload of tracks to choose from, and most of the time, you may not have to look beyond them.\n\nBut if you fully rely on Instagram Reels\u2019 built-in music library, chances are pretty high that you might soon find the library insufficient for your out-of-the-box clips. And that\u2019s when you would need to look beyond. But bother not, there are several reliable sites that offer legal and free music. So, the next time you want to use some unique music in your video, do keep this Instagram Reels trick in mind.\n\n18. Give A Personal Touch to the Audio\n\nIt\u2019s always better to give your personal touch to the music, which not only sets your content apart but also showcases your creative aspect. As someone who has a penchant for sharing fun-loving videos, I like to fine-tune audio and also add voiceover (on some occasions) to make it different.\n\nAdobe Audition, Logic Pro X, and Audacity are undoubtedly the best audio editors that you can use to customize your audio proficiently. However, if you want to go for easy-to-use free audio editors, I recommend you try out Presonus Studio One and Ardour. Head over to our extensive roundup of the best audio editing softwares for more information.\n\n19. Use Audio from Other Instagram Reels\n\nHave you ever run into a cool Instagram Reel and wished you could use that audio for your own Reel? Turns out, the video-sharing platform provides an official way to use original audio from other Reels. To get it done, open the Reel whose audio you want to use. Then, tap on the \u201cOriginal Audio\u201d option located at the top of the video.\n\nOn the next screen, tap on the Use Audio button at the bottom. Next, you will be directed to the Reels camera, where you can start recording with the original audio. Do note that the original audio is always credited to the original creator.\n\n20. Remix Instagram Reels to Create Exciting Clips\n\nRecently, Instagram introduced a long-awaited feature called \u201cRemix\u201d that is similar to TikTok\u2019s Duet. Going by the trend, remixed videos have been getting a lot of attention on the video-sharing platform. Whether you want to parody existing reels or wish to make a match with a popular video, Remix can have a role to play. So, be sure to incorporate this Instagram Reels trick into your arsenal to widen your exposure.\n\nBear in mind that the Remix feature is enabled only for new videos by default. So, if you want to go all new, you will need to manually enable it for your old reels.\n\nTo get started with Instagram Reels, launch Instagram and then open a Reels video. After that, tap on the three dots menu and select Remix This Reel. Now, go ahead and either record a new response video or choose one from your camera roll. As usual, you have effects and built-in editing tools to adorn your reel. When you are happy with your creativity, add a suitable caption and share it.\n\nIf you want to enable Remix for old videos, tap on the three dots menu at the bottom right corner and choose Enable Remix option. To find out more about Remix and how it works, head over to our detailed guide on how to use Instagram Remix Reels feature.\n\nSuper Handy Instagram Reels Tips and Tricks to Stay Ahead in 2021\n\nThere you go!
